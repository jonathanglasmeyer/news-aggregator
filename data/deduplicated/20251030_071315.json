      "published": "2025-10-29T23:20:53",
      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\nMicrosoft Azure, the company’s cloud computing service, has experienced an outage just one week after issues with AWS took out swaths of the internet. The issues impacted Microsoft’s services that run on Azure, including Microsoft 365, Xbox, and even Minecraft. Other companies, like Capital One, Alaska Airlines, and Starbucks, also had outages that were linked to the problems with Azure.\n\nOn Azure’s status page, Microsoft’s messages have linked the outage to an “inadvertent configuration change” and DNS problem. As Microsoft reported its earnings on Wednesday afternoon, its main website continued to load slowly as the outage dragged on.\n\nAn update on Microsoft’s status page at 7:40PM ET included this information:\n\n\nStarting at approximately 16:00 UTC on 29 October 2025, customers and Microsoft services leveraging Azure Front Door (AFD) may have experienced latencies, timeouts, and errors. We have confirmed that an inadvertent configuration change was the trigger event for this issue.\n\n\n\nAffected Azure services may have included, but were not limited to:\n\n\n\nApp Service, Azure Active Directory B2C, Azure Communication Services, Azure Databricks, Azure Healthcare APIs, Azure Maps, Azure Portal, Azure SQL Database, Azure Virtual Desktop, Container Registry, Media Services, Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management, Microsoft Entra ID (Mobility Management Policy Service, Identity &amp; Access Management, and User Management UX), Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Sentinel (Threat Intelligence), and Video Indexer.\n\n\n\nThe AFD service is now operating above 98% availability.

The airlines advise customers to see an agent at the airport to get their boarding pass if they couldn’t check in online.\n\nCommunity Fibre, an internet provider in the UK, similarly confirmed that some customers may have experienced issues due to the Microsoft outage. Additionally, Kroger told customers that its site and mobile apps were “experiencing an unexpected outage,” while Starbucks’ and Costco’s websites and apps weren’t loading, and users reported issues with Capital One.\n\n\nA global outage impacted the Microsoft Azure platform today where several Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines services are hosted, causing a disruption to key systems, including our websites.Our teams worked quickly to stand up our backup infrastructure to allow our guests to book and…&mdash; Alaska Airlines News (@AlaskaAirNews) October 29, 2025\n\n\n\nOur configuration deployment and traffic rebalancing is showing steady service health improvement for the various affected M365 services.

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\tRode’s Wireless Micro Camera Kit includes a charging case to extend the battery life of its receivers and mics.﻿ | Image: Rode\t\n\nLast November, Rode launched its Wireless Micro microphone system that paired two tiny lavalier mics with a small receiver that connected to your phone’s charging port. Rode later gave that product a free upgrade, sending out another receiver that let the mics connect to digital cameras, too. Now, the company is launching an updated version of that receiver with an OLED screen —&nbsp;but this time, it’s charging for it.\n\nThe new version of Rode’s wireless camera receiver is now available as part of a Wireless Micro Camera Kit that bundles it with two Wireless Micro lavalier mics and an additional wireless receiver used to connect the mics to mobile devices using their USB-C or Lightning ports. The kit is priced at $149, which is what Rode’s Wireless Micro system was initially priced at when it launched last November (minus a camera receiver) before getting a price cut earlier this month to $99 when new color options were introduced. Rode’s wireless lav mics still don’t offer as much functionality as DJI’s offerings like the Mic Mini or Mic 3, but they’re more competitively priced.\n\nAs with the original, the new receiver is designed to sit atop cameras by connecting to their cold shoe mount while audio from up to two wireless mics is delivered to the camera through a USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable. Battery life is estimated to be up to seven hours and is maximized by the receiver only powering on when it’s connected to a camera. The receiver’s runtime can be further extended to up to 21 hours using the Wireless Micro Camera Kit’s charging case when you’re away from a power source.\n\nThe 1.1-inch OLED screen shows details about the battery life and signal strength of the receiver and wirelessly connected devices. It works alongside three buttons for navigating and adjusting various settings including gain assist levels, but for ease of use the receiver can also make those adjustments automatically to suppress volume spikes and ensure all the audio coming into the camera is perfectly balanced.",

The indictment alleges that Abughazaleh and a handful of other protesters conspired on the morning of September 26th to prevent an ICE agent “from discharging the duties of his office, and to injure him in his person or property.”\n\nThe indictment accuses Abughazaleh and the other protesters named in it of banging on an ICE agent’s car and attempting to stop it from entering an ICE facility by physically surrounding it, scratching the word “PIG” into the car, breaking a side mirror, and breaking off a rear windshield wiper. As MSNBC reports, other defendants include Michael Rabbitt, a Cook County Democratic Committee member, and Cat Sharp, a candidate for the Cook County Board of Commissioners, and the charges of assaulting an officer can carry prison sentences of up to eight years.\n\nA video of Abughazaleh being thrown to the ground by an ICE agent outside the Broadview facility went viral in September, and on the same morning as the incident cited in the indictment, she posted a video on X of her and other protesters surrounding an ICE vehicle. \n\nAs MSNBC notes, in recent weeks, right-wing accounts have repeatedly posted about her videos, calling for her to be arrested and tagging US Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the same time, Trump has said that Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be jailed for allegedly “failing to protect” ICE officers. The Trump Administration has also charged or threatened criminal charges against others who’ve opposed his agenda, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. \n\nAbughazaleh, who has a background as a journalist and influencer on social media channels like Twitch, posted a video today responding to the indictment, stating:\n\n\n“This is a political prosecution, and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks out against them. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges.”\n\n\nAbughazaleh goes on to note that “ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters.” She also calls out the Trump administration for “weaponizing the federal justice system” to scare protesters, but vows “we’re not going to be silent.”&nbsp;\n\n“This case targets our rights to protest, speak freely, and associate with anyone who disagrees with the government.”&nbsp;",

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\nXbox sales have been tanking for a while now —&nbsp;and the story hasn’t gotten any brighter. Microsoft just released its Q1 2026 earnings and Xbox hardware revenue was down 29 percent year-over-year. Last quarter, it was down 22 percent. Down 29 percent in the first two quarters of 2025, down 42 percent in Q4 of 2024… You get the picture.&nbsp;\n\nAs tariffs and inflation take their toll, Microsoft has dramatically increased the prices on its gaming hardware, with the Series X now starting at $599.99. Microsoft’s response has been to deemphasize the console and pursue an “Xbox everywhere” strategy. That has yielded some success on the content and services front, though revenue there was largely flat this quarter, only growing one percent year over year.\n\nMicrosoft would obviously like to see more growth there. The company has reportedly been pursuing dramatic 30 percent profit margins there, leading to layoffs and cancelled projects. But the company’s outlook for Q2 isn’t much rosier. It expects Xbox hardware revenue to continue to decline, and content and services to continue low-single digits growth. \n\nMicrosoft did see hardware growth from Windows OEM and Devices, with revenue increasing a modest 6 percent year over year. The company stopped reporting Surface earnings separately, so it’s unclear how those devices are performing. They had been on a steady decline for several years.\n\nIt’s Azure and cloud services that remain the driving force behind Microsoft’s ascent. The growth of its intelligent cloud services is substantial. Revenue increased 28 percent year over year to $30.9 billion, with Azure specifically growing 40 percent.&nbsp;\n\nMore broadly, Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, an increase of 26 percent from Q1 2025. The company’s cloud divisions and Azure have been growing steadily for several years now.&nbsp;\n\nIn total, Microsoft reported $77.7 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 18 percent from the same time last year. And its net income was $27.7 billion, up 12 percent. While those increases are largely driven by the company’s various cloud offerings, its productivity and business processes still account for a significant portion of its income ($33 billion).\n\nUpdate, October 29th: This article was updated with details from Microsoft’s earnings call. The headline was also updated to specify that it was hardware sales that were down.",

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\tThese laptops can help you get work done. | Illustration by William Joel / The Verge\t\n\nBuying the right laptop can be stressful. It’s likely one of the bigger tech purchases you’ll make, and there are a ludicrous number of models, sizes, form factors, and configurations to pick from. We review and test a wide swath of them here at The Verge, and we’re constantly considering what’s the best and who it’s best for.\n\nOur overall pick for most people has been, and continues to be, the MacBook Air — particularly, as of March 2025, the M4 model. Unless you’re forced to use Windows for specific software needs or you fancy yourself a hardcore gamer, it remains the best option for the average user who wants something portable with excellent battery life and great performance for productivity tasks.\n\nThough the MacBook Air is the easy recommendation for most people, that doesn’t make it the answer for everyone. What if you need more power for video or photo editing, or crunching large datasets? What if you prefer to run Windows? What if you play lots of games and want to take them with you? Or what if you just want something unique — or even, gasp, repairable? We’ve got some recommendations, including a Chromebook or two, a laptop with two screens, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, and the Microsoft Surface Laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite chip.\n\n\n\nThe best laptop\nApple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)\n\nScore: 9ProsConsEasily lasts a full day on batteryExcellent choice for most people’s everyday needsNails the basics in a thin-and-light while feeling like a nice place to beStill starts with just 256GB of storageStill has limited portsStill prone to throttling under heavy creative tasks\nWhere to Buy: $999 $799.99 at Amazon $999 $799 at Best Buy $999 $899 at B&amp;H Photo\nCPU: M4 (10-core) / GPU: M4 (8- or 10-core) / RAM: 16GB, 24GB, 32GB / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 13.6-inch or 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, 2560 x 1664 or&nbsp;2880 x 1864 , 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches (13-inch) or 13.40 x 9.35 x 0.45 inches (15-inch) / Weight: 2.7 pounds (13-inch) or 3.3 pounds (15-inch)\n\nApple’s M4 MacBook Air is the best laptop for most people — Mac users, of course, but also the platform-agnostic or anyone who wants a no-fuss, straightforward machine that doesn’t bombard them with advertisements or bloatware. It’s a productivity laptop that can do a bit of everything. The 13-inch model starts with 16GB of RAM at $999 (it’s often cheaper than this), and it also comes in a 15-inch version for $1,199, for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis, especially at these prices.\n\nDespite losing its way around the mid-2010s, Apple has a long history of sending quality MacBooks to market, and the Air M4 is no different. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, and MagSafe charging, check. Those were also true on the previous models, but now with the M4 generation it also features the same 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam of the MacBook Pros, can use two external monitors with its lid open, and comes in a sky blue color (though it still looks silver in some light). And again, you get all this for less money than before. \n\nThe M4 Air is a great option for just about anyone who doesn’t need video editing, heavy gaming, or more than two USB-C ports. For those that do, look to the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 — a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599, complete with the latest, fastest processor that Apple makes. Opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more headroom and features like a third USB-C port, an SD card slot, and an even better screen.\n\nNow that the M4 Air is here, Apple has fully discontinued the M3 and M2 models. You might still be able to find them at retailers like Best Buy, but they’re not worth it over the M4 unless substantially discounted. If you can afford an additional $200 on top of either the 13- or 15-inch M4 Air’s starting prices, that’ll net you 512GB of storage instead of 256GB — as well as the 10-core GPU on the 13-inch. The paltry base storage is the only remaining weak point of the MacBook Air. It’s definitely worth getting more, as the roomier SSD will make your life a little easier on a laptop that should easily last you five to seven (or even more) years.\nApple MacBook Air 15 (2025, M4)\n\nScore: 9ProsConsEasily lasts a full day on batteryExcellent choice for most people’s everyday needsNails the basics in a thin-and-light while feeling like a nice place to beLouder speakers over its smaller counterpartStill starts with just 256GB of storageStill has limited portsStill prone to throttling under heavy creative tasks\nWhere to Buy: $1199 $999.99 at Amazon $1199 $999.99 at Best Buy $1199 $999 at B&amp;H Photo\nRead our review of the Apple MacBook Air M4.\n\nBest Chromebook\nLenovo Chromebook Plus 14\n\nWhere to Buy: $749 at Best Buy\nCPU: MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 / GPU: Immortalis G925 / RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X / Storage: 256GB UFS 4.0 / Display: Touch 14-inch FHD 1920 x 1200, 60Hz OLED, 400 nits / Dimensions: 12.37 x 8.63 x 0.62 inches / Weight: 2.78 pounds&nbsp;\n\nLenovo’s Chromebook Plus 14 is the best model we’ve tested so far in 2025 because of its impressive tech specs and long software support. It has a 14-inch FHD (1920 x 1200) 60Hz OLED touchscreen display that has excellent color and contrast, as well as 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Its 8-core MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 processor was powerful enough that we could jump between Chrome tabs and Android apps spread across two desktops while uploading documents to NotebookLM to generate audio overviews without any problems. \n\nLenovo equipped this laptop with two USB-C ports, which can drive a couple of monitors simultaneously, and a USB-A port that’s convenient for connecting accessories without the need for a dongle. All three ports top out at 5Gbps each though, which might be slower than you need. We were impressed by the laptop’s speakers, which sounded great when listening to music or audiobooks, even at a high volume. Its keyboard was comfortable to type on, but the mechanical trackpad makes an annoying, loud click when pressed. \n\nThe Chromebook Plus 14 can run Android, Linux, and web apps. You should be able to easily find the right software across those platforms, but we still ran into trouble with Zoom, which ran poorly as a web app and as an Android app. Similarly, we had to run Slack in a browser window because the Linux app wasn’t compiled for Arm processors. The types of apps you use will also heavily impact battery life. We were able to run the laptop for around nine hours and only drained its battery by around 50 percent. We suspect you could use it for a couple of days without charging if your needs aren’t incredibly demanding.\n\nSoftware support is an understandable concern when getting a new laptop, but Google has guaranteed Chromebooks released after 2021 will receive 10 years of automatic updates. The Lenovo Chromebook 14’s solid hardware and extended software support means you may be able to keep it running for a decade, even if later becomes a secondary machine or hand-me-down. \n\nRead our review of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14\n\nBest Snapdragon X laptop\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (13.8-inch)\n\nScore: 8ProsConsAll-day battery lifeGreat performance for most apps16GB of RAM for the base modelGame support is limitedAI features feel gimmickyEmulated apps can hit battery and performance\nWhere to Buy: $1199.99 $888.91 at Amazon (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) $1199.99 $949.99 at Microsoft (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) $1399.99 at Best Buy (X Elite, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)\nCPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus X1P-64-100, Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100 / GPU: Qualcomm Adreno / RAM: 16GB, 32GB, 64GB LPDDR5X (soldered) / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB / Display: 13.8-inch touchscreen LCD, 2304 x 1536 120Hz, 600 nits / Dimensions: 11.85 x 8.67 x 0.69 inches / Weight: 2.96 pounds\n\nOut of all the Snapdragon Copilot Plus PCs we’ve tested so far, the 13.8- and 15-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th edition stood out for their balance of performance, exceptional battery life and standby time, and quality components (120Hz screen, keyboard, webcam, trackpad, etc.). Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air, and the Surface Laptop mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. It’s the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night. And if your budget is slightly tighter, there’s a 13-inch model with pared-down features starting at $899 that’s still really good.\n\nThe greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is whether Windows on Arm supports all the apps you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there can still be some outliers, especially in content creation apps. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips. Snapdragon X laptops can only run a fraction of the games you find on Steam, and Microsoft is just beginning to roll out the ability to install ARM64-compatible games from the Xbox app. In many cases you’ll only be able to stream games available in the PC Game Pass library.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft launched Intel Lunar Lake- based versions of the Surface Laptop 7, but they’re a ridiculous $500 more expensive, and aimed solely at businesses. It’s a shame, because having this hardware with Lunar Lake’s compatibility might have been an appealing prospect. \n\nRead our review of the 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition.\n\nThe best 16-inch Windows laptop\nAsus Zenbook S 16\n\nScore: 8ProsConsIt’s gorgeousIncredibly thin and light for a 16-inch laptopGreat performance, especially the integrated graphicsShorter battery life than major competitorsStoryCube doesn’t workCouldn’t get a sense of how fast the NPU really is\nWhere to Buy: $1799.99 at Asus $1799.99 at Best Buy\nCPU: AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 / GPU: Radeon 890M, Radeon 880M&nbsp; / RAM: 32GB, 24GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: touch 16-inch 2880 x 1800, 120Hz OLED with stylus support, 500 nits peak HDR / Dimensions: 13.92 x 9.57 x 0.47 ~ 0.51 inches / Weight: 3.21 pounds \n\nThe 16-inch Asus Zenbook S 16 is the best-looking, best-performing Windows laptop we’ve tested so far; it’s also so thin and lightweight you wouldn’t know it just by holding it! It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a separate graphics card. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.\n\nThere are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,800 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)\n\nAt just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff. There’s still no other Windows laptop that offers as much performance and versatility in a 16-inch chassis for the price.\n\nRead our review of the Asus Zenbook S 16.\n\nThe best laptop for high-end gaming\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\n\nScore: 8ProsConsGreat graphics performance in the latest high-end gamesLots of ports and easy access to RAM / SSDsAnimated lid and wraparound RGB are funVery good QHD / 240Hz Mini LED screenTypical gaming laptop issues (pricey, hefty, and not great battery life)Competition offers OLED screensCustomizing lid animations is a pain\nWhere to Buy: $3299.99 $2799.99 at Walmart $3299.99 at Asus\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 / RAM: 32GB / Storage: 2TB / Display: 16-inch Mini LED 2560 x 1600, 240Hz display / Dimensions: 13.94 x 10.55 x 0.9 to 1.21 inches / Weight: 6.17 pounds\n\nI’m still testing a handful of different gaming laptops, including the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 and HP Omen Max 16, but the frontrunner so far (by a nose) is the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 with an Nvidia RTX 5080 GPU. From what I’ve seen so far, the 5080 is the sweet spot for high-end gaming laptops in this generation. The 5080 ROG Strix Scar is within earshot of the 5090 performance I saw in the Razer Blade 16, and it’s $1,200 cheaper. The Asus is chunky and heavy compared to Razer’s svelte Blade, but that gives its GPU the space it needs to stay cool. Thinner laptops often thermally constrain a high-end chip like the 5090.\n\nThe ROG Strix Scar doesn’t have an OLED display like its direct competitors, which is indeed a bummer, but its 2560 x 1600 240Hz Mini LED panel is still sharp and bright, with some punchy colors. The 16-inch version of the Strix Scar eschews a number pad, giving its large keycaps plenty of space so typing isn’t cramped at all. Its trackpad is massive, and it houses a hidden touch-sensitive numpad you can call up with a long-press in the top corner — though it’s more useful for data entry than gaming needs.\n\nThe Strix Scar’s boisterous RGB light show is kind of fun in its garishness. In addition to wraparound underglow, it has a dot-matrix array of LEDs on its lid to display animations — as Asus has done before. A more useful feature is the way you can open up the laptop’s bottom plate like the hood of a car for easy, tool-free access to its two RAM slots and SSDs.\n\nThe best MacBook for photo and video editing\nApple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro / Max, 16-inch)\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and 14-core CPU / 20-core GPU. The M4 Max version offers 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, 14-core CPU / 32-core GPU, and can be configured to ridiculously high prices. Both models have Thunderbolt 5 ports, 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam, and options for anti-glare displays.\n\nWhere to Buy: $2499 $2234.8 at Amazon (M4 Pro) $2499 at Best Buy (M4 Pro) $3499 $3119.99 at Amazon (M4 Max)\nCPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / GPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / RAM: 24GB or 48GB (M4 Pro),  36GB &#8211; 128 GB (M4 Max) / Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 14.2 / 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR, 3024 x 1964 / 3456 x 2234, adaptive refresh up to 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 (14-inch) / 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches (16-inch) / Weight: 3.5 / 4.7 pounds (M4 Pro), 3.6 / 4.8 pounds (M4 Max) \n\nIf you need power for intensive creative work — like 3D rendering and working with ultra-high-resolution photos and video — the MacBook Pro is your best bet. Both the 14- and 16-inch models are available with powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max processors. There’s also a 14-inch Pro with a standard M4 processor, and while it’s a formidable step up from the MacBook Air as an everyman’s “pro” laptop, the M4 Pro and Max processors still outclass it in performance.\n\nProcessors aside, the MacBook Pro has remained largely unchanged since 2021. It has a bright, beautiful, color-accurate, high-res screen with HDR and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz; amazing speakers, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad; and a good port loadout: three Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, plus HDMI 2.1 and an SD card slot. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a few hundred dollars cheaper than the 16-inch, but aside from the very lowest processor options, most configurations are available in either size, so pick whichever works for you.\n\nIn our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The top-of-the-line 16-inch M4 Max model easily lasted all day in our most recent testing, with no battery-saving features enabled and even keeping the screen on full-time.\n\nMost people who need much more power than a MacBook Air — including all but the most demanding pro photographers — will be fine with an M4 Pro model, which starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch starts at $2,499 for a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and 512GB SSD. The M4 Pro chip can be configured with up to 48GB of memory and a 4TB SSD, at the usual absurd Apple markups, and it supports up to two external 6K displays.\n\nIf you absolutely need more GPU power — or more than two external monitors — you can step up to the M4 Max. The base M4 Max with 14 CPU cores and 32 GPU cores, plus 36GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, starts at $3,199 in the 14-inch and $3,499 in the 16-inch. There’s also an M4 Max with 16 CPU and 40 GPU cores, which starts at $3,699 and $3,999, respectively. The M4 Max models are configurable with up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage and can support up to four external monitors. The vast majority of people don’t have workloads heavy enough to notice a significant difference between the M4 Pro and M4 Max; if you do, you probably know it.\nApple MacBook Pro 14 (2025, M5)\n\nScore: 9ProsConsEverything good about the M4 model, with just a little more speedStill a very good value for an all-purpose creative workflow machineBest-in-class battery lifeJust a snoozer of an updateSpace black finish can still be a little smudgyApple’s price structure may still have you longing for M4 Pro / Max\nWhere to Buy: $1599 at Apple $1599 at Best Buy $1599 at Amazon\nRead our reviews of the MacBook Pro 16 M4 Pro / Max and MacBook Pro 14 M5.\n\nThe best 14-inch gaming laptop\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)\n\nProsConsBalanced performance, battery life, and portabilityOLED displayProgrammable LED strip on the lidGreat keyboard and smooth trackpadGets a bit hot and loud under loadSoldered RAMThermally throttles its GPUs\nWhere to Buy: $1799.99 at Best Buy (5060) $2099.99 at Asus $2399.99 at  Best Buy (5070 Ti)\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 270, HX 370 / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, RTX 5070, RTX 5070 TI, RTX 5080 / RAM: 16GB, 32GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 14-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 120Hz, 500 nits / Dimensions: 12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 inches / Weight: 3.31 pounds\n\nAsus recently introduced an updated ROG Zephyrus G14 for 2025, which replaces the previous model as our pick for the best 14-inch gaming laptop. It retains the sleek design Asus introduced last year and continues to strike a balance between power and portability; it also incorporates a handful of improvements, some of which have allowed it to earn the top spot in our best gaming laptops guide, despite a $100 price bump. \n\nThe updated Zephyrus G14 has an AMD 9-series processor and Nvidia RTX 50-series graphics chip, which provide modest performance gains. Every configuration features a handsome, high-res OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, so smoother gameplay isn’t locked behind an optional upgrade. Conveniently, the 2025 G14 features USB-C ports on both sides for charging, although you’ll still achieve the maximum wattage by using Asus’ proprietary charger. \n\nThe G14 features a backlit, chiclet-style keyboard, and Asus has increased the keycap size by 12.24 percent to make them easier to press. The centered trackpad is also relatively wide, providing ample space for clicks, taps, and swipes without cramping your hand. These features are as useful for typing and productivity work as they are for playing games when you’re not connected to a gaming keyboard and mouse. \n\nSpeaking of games, the titles we played ran well, even on high settings, but the laptop felt hot to the touch due to its thin chassis. Its fans were audible under heavy load, and the laptop eventually thermally throttled its GPUs to prevent overheating. The tradeoffs aren’t surprising, though, especially given the G14’s thin, lightweight design.\n\nThe best dual-screen laptop\nLenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)\n\nScore: 8ProsConsBold designGreat speakers for their sizeIncluded stylus and mouseAwkward to put awayFew ports\nWhere to Buy: $2199.99 at Best Buy\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 155U / GPU: Intel UHD (integrated) / RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X / Storage: 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD / Display: 13.3-inch (2880 x 1800) 60Hz OLED touchscreen w/ stylus support / Dimensions: 11.78 x 8.03 x 0.63 inches / Weight: 2.95 pounds\n\nA dual-screen laptop is exactly what it sounds like: a laptop with a second screen where the keyboard normally goes.\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Book 9i has a 360-degree hinge, which lets you use it as a regular laptop, a (large) tablet, and more. You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. You can set it up at home with an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement, or take it on the go with the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.\n\nThe Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away. But it’s also heavier (at 3.64 pounds), its top lid doesn’t fold back far enough to use it as a tablet, and its touchscreen gestures aren’t as responsive.\n\nRead our head-to-head review of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i and the Asus Zenbook Duo.\n\nThe best repairable laptop\nFramework Laptop 13 (2025, AMD Ryzen AI 7 350)\n\nScore: 9ProsConsStill the repairability champ with excellent, modular port selectionFaster CPU performance over both Intel and previous AMD modelsHigh-res 3:2 aspect ratio screen is great for productivityThin, light, and an overall great packageRadeon 860M iGPU performance is a little lackingTrackpad still feels a little cheapScreen is a little lacking in contrast and color qualityLess repairable laptops offer more for similar prices or less\nWhere to Buy: $899 at Framework\nCPU: AMD Ryzen AI 5 340,  AI 7 350, AI 9 HX 370 / GPU: Radeon 860M / RAM: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, 48GB, 96GB / Storage: 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 13.5 inch IPS, 2256 x 1504 60Hz or 2880 x 1920 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.68 x 9.01 x 0.62 inches / Weight: 2.87 pounds\n\nThere’s no other laptop offering the kind of nerdy fun today that a Framework is.

Otherwise, it’s much the same chassis as the prior generation — they’re indistinguishable from one another.\n\nBut that’s part of what’s so cool about a Framework: a new model means a new chip you can even put into the old model, if you want an upgrade and don’t mind opening up the chassis yourself. It’s actually much easier to do than you may fear, as Framework designs its laptops to give you full access to everything inside with just a simple screwdriver; including its mainboard, storage, RAM, battery, and some fun see-through bezels for a touch of customization. \n\nIf you opt for one of Framework’s DIY Editions it only comes partially built, but this allows you to choose from many more configuration options than its pre-builts. Personally, I think the DIY route is the way to go if you’re up for it, because experiencing the assembly (which took me less than 30 minutes) gives you a better awareness of what’s in your laptop and how to change something if you ever need to repair or upgrade it. But even if you choose a pre-built, you can pick from a wide array of modular ports to outfit it with.\n\nThe Laptop 13 isn’t as sleek as a similarly priced MacBook or Surface, which offer no upgradeability or modularity (aside from the SSD on some Surface Laptops), but the Framework by no means feels cheap. It’s thin enough and light enough to be very portable, and it’s got a great keyboard with a fine trackpad. Its screen has a 3:2 aspect ratio that’s ideal for productivity since you can see a bit more than the more typical 16:10.\n\nYou probably have to be really into the whole repairability and modularity concept to spend the same or more on a Framework Laptop 13 compared to other options out there, but anyone can appreciate picking your ports and being able to swap them around whenever you want.\n\nRead our Framework Laptop 13 (2025) review.\n\nWhat’s new\n\n\nWe recently published our review of Acer’s Chromebook Plus Spin 514, which was announced at IFA 2025 and is now available starting at $699.99. The machine runs on a power-efficient MediaTek Kompanio Ultra processor paired with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 flash storage. Its 14-inch touchscreen has a resolution of 1920 x 1200 or 2880 x 1800 depending on your configuration. The screen can be flipped 360 degrees, so you can use the Chromebook as a tablet. You can also spec it with either a 1080p or 5-megapixel webcam. The laptop is equipped with a pair of 10Gbps USB-C ports with DisplayPort and Power Delivery, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. It has excellent battery life and speedy performance, but you might be disappointed by its speaker performance. Also, it’s a questionable value since Lenovo’s Chromebook Plus mentioned above in this guide is just $50 more but includes an OLED screen and more RAM.\n\n\n\nWe were able to put Framework’s GPU upgrade claims to the test by swapping out an AMD Radeon RX 7700S for Nvidia’s RTX 5070 on a Framework 16 laptop. The swap was conducted in Framework’s office on a laptop they provided (our review unit would’ve required BIOS and software updates that aren’t publicly available yet), but it only took us three minutes. The graphics card upgrade costs $699 and will be available in December. The company also introduced a 240W USB-C charger, which also ships in December and is available for preorder now.\n\n\n\nApple’s 14-inch MacBook Pro with the new M5 processor debuted in October, starting at $1,599.99 for the model with 16GB RAM and 512GB of storage. It’s very much a chip bump of an upgrade, delivering minor improvements in benchmark testing. If you can find the M4 version at a reasonable discount, you won’t be missing out on much. Read our review.\n\n\nMonica Chin and Nathan Edwards also contributed to previous versions of this buying guide.\n\nUpdate, October 29th: Adjusted pricing and availability. Added information about Apple’s new 14-inch M5-powered MacBook Pro, which is identical in design to the M4 model it’s replacing, but a little faster with some tasks.

Apple recently launched its 2025 iPhone lineup, which includes the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and a brand-new model, the ultra-thin iPhone Air. These new phones offer a number of new features over their predecessors, such as upgraded cameras, faster chips, better battery life, and even better screens — Apple Intelligence, however, is still a work in progress.\n\nAlongside the new hardware, Apple also launched iOS 26 (yes, the numbering system has changed and we’re jumping from iOS 18), which includes a new Liquid Glass user interface, live translation, wallpapers in messages, and more. The software marks Apple’s biggest visual redesign since iOS 7, and despite some very polarizing reactions, we think it looks fine.\n\nIf your current iPhone is humming along, there’s no need to rush out and get a new one. But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone that’s a few generations old, then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains to be had this time around, especially in the basic iPhone 17, which features a higher-refresh-rate display than last year’s model for smoother-looking animations, plus double the base storage to 256GB — all without raising the price, despite the current tariff situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best iPhone for most people\nApple iPhone 17\n\nScore: 8ProsConsAlways-on display makes it vastly more usefulHigh refresh rate makes using the phone smootherThe cameras are solidBattery lasts well through the dayThe price isn’t going upNo redesign, but the green is niceZoom capabilities are weak compared to the ProGets hot during heavy gaming sessionsApple Intelligence is still somewhere between useless and MIA\nWhere to Buy: $799 at Apple (256GB) $829.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $999 at Apple (512GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;A19 /&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;Not advertised /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe / Qi2 /&nbsp;Weather-resistance rating:&nbsp;IP68\n\nThe iPhone 17 marks a turning point for the standard model. After years with a lower-quality screen, the cheapest model finally got two major upgrades for 2025: an always-on display and a high-refresh-rate panel. These features make it feel meaningfully better than the iPhone 16 and prior models in everyday use, bringing it closer than ever to the Pro models. And at the same $799 starting price as the previous generation, this year’s update is a no-brainer.\n\nWhile the iPhone 17’s 48-megapixel main camera is carried over from last year, the ultrawide camera has been changed from a 12-megapixel sensor to a 48-megapixel sensor, and it delivers sharper and more vibrant photos. The device features an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie camera, which is also in the Air and 17 Pro. Your selfies may not look materially better, but the front camera’s square sensor elevates the user experience, making it possible to take horizontal selfies while holding the device vertically (no need to rotate the phone).\n\nApple also gives you double the storage — 256GB versus 128GB in the base iPhone 16 — and improved battery life. The standard 17 still lacks a proper telephoto camera, and the A19 chip is slower than the A19 Pro found in the Pro models. Still, it’s a big step up in almost every way, even if it looks basically the same as every iPhone from the past six years.\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 review.\n\nThe best high-end iPhone\niPhone 17 Pro\n\nScore: 8ProsConsSolid battery lifeBrighter screen outdoorsCenter Stage cameraFaster chargingDoesn’t get blazing hotOrangeWhat’s up with Siri?Heavier than last year\nWhere to Buy: $1099 at Apple (256GB) $1099.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $1299 at Apple (512GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;A19 Pro /&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;Not advertised /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;40W wired, 25W MagSafe / Qi2 /&nbsp;Weather-resistance rating:&nbsp;IP68\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro introduces a bold redesign and a number of notable upgrades, including the lineup’s most advanced camera setup yet. It also features rounded edges, and similar to last year, it’s on equal footing with the 17 Pro Max in terms of performance; the biggest differences that the Pro Max offers a larger display, a larger battery, and up to 2TB of storage.\n\nWhereas the iPhone 17 is for most people, the 17 Pro is more geared toward creators. The device has three 48-megapixel cameras, including a 48-megapixel telephoto, and it offers several pro features aimed at those who want to take the best possible photos and videos. Some of those features include Genlock support, which lets videographers sync up timecodes across multiple cameras, and support for ProRes RAW recording. It also sports the upgraded Center Stage selfie camera found in other 2025 iPhone models.\n\nDespite the additions and improvements, there’s little here that makes the 17 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. However, it comes in an irresistible orange, which is apparently the new “it” color.\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 Pro review.\n\nThe iPhone with the best battery life\niPhone 17 Pro Max\n\nScore: 8ProsConsSolid battery lifeBrighter screen outdoorsCenter Stage cameraFaster chargingDoesn’t get blazing hotOrangeWhat’s up with Siri?Heavier than last year\nWhere to Buy: $1199 at Apple (256GB) $1199.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $1399 at Apple (512GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;6.9-inch 2868 x 1320 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;A19 Pro /&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;Not advertised /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;40W wired, 25W MagSafe / Qi2 /&nbsp;Weather-resistance rating:&nbsp;IP68\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max’s redesign isn’t just about looks. Apple hollowed out the device’s aluminum frame to fit in the biggest battery yet in an iPhone. Apple says the device offers up 39 hours of video playback, which is 12 more hours than last year’s iPhone 16 Plus, our previous battery champ. The device can easily push through a full day and then some, though your mileage will vary depending on how often you play mobile games, watch videos, and doomscroll on social media.\n\nThere are other benefits to going with the 17 Pro Max. It has the largest display among the latest iPhone lineup — 6.9 inches — and offers up to 2TB of storage, giving creators more room than ever for storing their media. If you want the most iPhone you can possibly get, including the longest battery life, then the 17 Pro Max is the way to go.\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 Pro Max review.\n\nThe best iPhone for people who hate bulky phones\niPhone Air\n\nScore: 7ProsConsEasier to carry thanks to its slim profileRemarkably light and more pleasant to use for long periods of timeBattery drains quicker than a standard phoneNo ultrawide camera\nWhere to Buy: $999 at Apple (256GB) $999.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $1199 at Apple (512GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;6.5-inch 2736 x 1260 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;A19 Pro /&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 18-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;Not advertised /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;30W wired, 20W MagSafe / Qi2 /&nbsp;Weather-resistance rating:&nbsp;IP68\n\nThe iPhone Air is Apple’s biggest redesign since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It’s shockingly thin and light, at 5.6mm and 165 grams, respectively. Thanks to its titanium frame and Ceramic Shield 2 display, it’s more durable than you might expect, too. The device feels deceptively small, despite having a 6.5-inch display. You really have to see and feel the phone yourself to get the appeal.\n\nBut the thinner design comes with a few substantial compromises compared to the other models available this year. One of the biggest is that the Air features a single 48-megapixel camera on the back. That’s not to say the device’s camera is bad. But it’s a far less versatile system than even the far more affordable iPhone 17, which has a dual-camera setup. The second compromise is on battery life, which is just okay. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great, either.\n\nAt $999, you’re paying a lot for middling battery life and camera performance. Those who primarily care about design, though, may be more forgiving about those shortcomings.\n\nRead our full iPhone Air review.\n\nThe best inexpensive-ish iPhone\niPhone 16E\n\nScore: 7ProsConsReliable performanceGood, if limited, camera systemIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buyNo MagSafe$599 feels like $100 too muchNo ultrawide\nWhere to Buy: $599 at Apple (128GB) $599.99 at Best Buy (128GB) $599.99 at Verizon (128GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;6.1-inch Super Retina XDR /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;A18&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48MP Fusion with 1x and 2x optical zoom, 12-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;Not advertised /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;20-watt wired, 7.5W Qi, no MagSafe/&nbsp;Weather-resistance rating:&nbsp;IP68\n\nThis recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing. \n\nThere’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it has basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control button (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation, given that it’s very much still a work-in-progress.\n\nThe 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn into something useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones.\n\nRead my full Apple iPhone 16E review.\n\n\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nApple’s latest iPhone lineup is available now, but there are already reports about what’s next. One report suggests Apple is readying a book-style foldable iPhone for 2026, which allegedly looks like two iPhone Air models put side by side. Apple is reportedly still working to flatten the crease that appears when the phone is unfolded, but has otherwise settled on a design. Looking ahead to 2027, a report claims Apple is planning a redesigned “all-screen” iPhone to celebrate the device’s 20th anniversary. These upcoming releases are allegedly part of Apple’s three-year plan — starting with the new iPhone Air — that’s aimed at refreshing its smartphone lineup.\n\nUpdate, October 29th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and additional related links.

After he offers to show his student ID instead, the officer turns to another and asks, “can you do facial?” As the other officer pulls up an app to scan the teen’s face, the first officer tells the teenager to “relax” while alleging that “a lot of parents” tell their kids they were born in the US. The video ends after the officer takes the minor’s photo and asks the teen to verify that his name matches what the app’s database pulled up.\nIt’s unclear which app the officers used during this Chicago stop. But 404 Media has been closely tracking ICE and CBP’s increasing use of face scans amid the Trump administration’s nationwide mass deportation campaign, which critics slam as largely rooted in racial profiling. Earlier this year, 404 Media reviewed leaked emails confirming that ICE was using Mobile Fortify, which allows agents to scan “an unprecedented number of government databases” and compare face matches against a database of 200 million images.Read full article\nComments",

Google’s video platform attracts more TV viewers than Netflix, Disney+, and all the other apps, and Google is looking to further beef up its big-screen appeal with a new raft of features, including shopping, immersive channel surfing, and an official version of the AI upscaling that had creators miffed a few months back.\nAccording to Google, YouTube’s growth has translated into higher payouts. The number of channels earning more than $100,000 annually is up 45 percent in 2025 versus 2024. YouTube is now giving creators some tools to boost their appeal (and hopefully their income) on TV screens. Those elaborate video thumbnails featuring surprised, angry, smiley hosts are about to get even prettier with the new 50MB file size limit. That’s up from a measly 2MB.\nVideo upscaling is also coming to YouTube, and creators will be opted in automatically. To start, YouTube will be upscaling lower-quality videos to 1080p.

      "content": "In 2007’s The Bucket List, Jack Nicholson’s billionaire magnate is a fan of a luxury coffee called kopi luwak, only to be informed that the beans first pass through the digestive tracts of civets and are harvested from their feces prior to roasting. The implication is that the billionaire just liked drinking gimmicky expensive coffee without realizing its less-than-luxurious origins. It’s one of the most expensive coffees in the world, ranging from $45 per pound to $590 per pound, depending on whether the beans are farmed or collected in the wild.\nWhether kopi luwak is worth that hefty price tag depends on who you ask. A Washington Post food critic once compared the beverage to stale Folgers, memorably describing the flavor as “petrified dinosaur droppings steeped in bathtub water.” Yet kopi luwak has many genuine fans who claim the coffee has a unique aroma and taste. Based on a new chemical analysis, they might have a point, according to a paper published in Scientific Reports.\nTechnically, kopi luwak is a method of processing, not a specific coffee bean variety. Asian palm civets hang around coffee plantations because they love to feast on ripened coffee berries; the berries constitute most of their diet, along with various seeds. The consumed berries undergo fermentation as they pass through the animal’s intestines, and the civets digest the pulp and excrete the beans. Coffee farmers then collect the scat to recover the excreted beans and process and roast them to produce kopi luwak.Read full article\nComments",

The milestone comes a mere three months after Nvidia crossed the $4 trillion mark in July, vaulting the company past tech giants like Apple and Microsoft in market valuation but also driving continued fears of an AI investment bubble.\nNvidia’s shares have climbed nearly 12-fold since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, as the AI boom propelled the S&amp;P 500 to record highs. Shares of Nvidia stock rose 4.6 percent on Wednesday following the Tuesday announcement at the company’s GTC conference. During a Bloomberg Television interview at the event, Huang dismissed concerns about overheated valuations, saying, “I don’t believe we’re in an AI bubble. All of these different AI models we’re using—we’re using plenty of services and paying happily to do it.”\nNvidia expects to ship 20 million units of its latest chips, compared to just 4 million units of the previous Hopper generation over its entire lifetime, Huang said at the conference. The $500 billion figure represents cumulative orders for the company’s Blackwell and Rubin processors through the end of 2026, though Huang noted that his projections did not include potential sales to China.Read full article\nComments",

      "content": "Since the dawn of civilization, leeches have been firmly attached to medicine. Therapeutic bloodsuckers are seen in murals decorating the tombs of 18th dynasty Egyptian pharaohs. They got their earliest written recommendation in the 2nd century BC by Greek poet and physician Nicander of Colophon. He introduced the “blood-loving leech, long flaccid and yearning for gore,” as a useful tool for sucking out poison after a bite from a poisonous animal. “Let leeches feed on [the] wounds and drink their fill,” he wrote. Ancient Chinese writing touted their medicinal potential, too, as did references in Sanskrit.\nGalen, the physician for Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, supported using leeches to balance the four humors (i.e. blood, phlegm, and yellow and black bile) and therefore treat ailments—as initially outlined by Hippocrates. Leeches, doctors found, provided a method for less painful, localized, and limited bloodletting. We now understand that leeches can release an anesthetic to prevent pain and a powerful anticoagulant, hirudin, to prevent clotting and keep blood flowing.\nIn the centuries since the Roman era, leeches’ popularity only grew. They were used to treat everything from gout to liver disease, epilepsy, and melancholy. The very word “leech” is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word “laece,” which translates to “physician.”Read full article\nComments",

      "content": "Trusted execution environments, or TEEs, are everywhere—in blockchain architectures, virtually every cloud service, and computing involving AI, finance, and defense contractors. It’s hard to overstate the reliance that entire industries have on three TEEs in particular: Confidential Compute from Nvidia, SEV-SNP from AMD, and SGX and TDX from Intel. All three come with assurances that confidential data and sensitive computing can’t be viewed or altered, even if a server has suffered a complete compromise of the operating kernel.\nA trio of novel physical attacks raises new questions about the true security offered by these TEES and the exaggerated promises and misconceptions coming from the big and small players using them.\nThe most recent attack, released Tuesday, is known as TEE.fail. It defeats the latest TEE protections from all three chipmakers. The low-cost, low-complexity attack works by placing a small piece of hardware between a single physical memory chip and the motherboard slot it plugs into. It also requires the attacker to compromise the operating system kernel. Once this three-minute attack is completed, Confidential Compute, SEV-SNP, and TDX/SDX can no longer be trusted. Unlike the Battering RAM and Wiretap attacks from last month—which worked only against CPUs using DDR4 memory—TEE.fail works against DDR5, allowing them to work against the latest TEEs.Read full article\nComments",

In 2019, the Supreme Court struck down an attempt by the first Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the census.\nBut now, a little-known algorithmic process called “differential privacy,” created to keep census data from being used to identify individual respondents, has become the right’s latest focus. WIRED spoke to six experts about the GOP’s ongoing effort to falsely allege that a system created to protect people’s privacy has made the data from the 2020 census inaccurate.Read full article\nComments",

Federal civil servants and NASA contractors are not getting paid during the shutdown, even if agency leaders have deemed their tasks essential and directed them to continue working. Jobs classified as essential include employees operating and safeguarding the International Space Station and NASA’s fleet of robotic probes exploring the Solar System and beyond.\nMany employees at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida remain at work, too. Their job is to keep the Artemis II mission on schedule for launch as soon as next February. In the four weeks since the start of the government shutdown, crews at Kennedy Space Center have completed several major milestones on the road to Artemis II, including the stacking of the Orion spacecraft atop its Space Launch System rocket inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building. This milestone, completed about one week ago, capped off assembly of the SLS rocket for Artemis II.Read full article\nComments",
