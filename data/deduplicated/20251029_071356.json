      "content": "In today’s newsletter: Meteorologists have called it ‘a dire situation unfolding in slow motion’ – what will it leave behind?Good morning. Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to hit Jamaica since records began in 1851, made landfall at about midday local time on Tuesday. With winds reaching 185mph and torrential rains, it knocked out power lines, cut off the internet, and demolished buildings; the death toll and extent of the damage are still unknown.The storm has already hit Haiti and the Dominican Republic; though it was at one stage downgraded to a tropical storm, now it has strengthened again and is expected to arrive imminently in Cuba, where more than 700,000 people have been evacuated. “The reports that are coming in are catastrophic,” Jamaican energy and transport minister Daryl Vaz told Sky News. “Not very much survives a Category 5 hurricane, in terms of infrastructure.”Economy | Rachel Reeves has said Britain can defy gloomy economic forecasts after the fiscal watchdog infuriated ministers by predicting a productivity downgrade would leave her with a £20bn gap to fill in her forthcoming budget.Sudan | Ethnically motivated mass killings and other atrocities are being reported from El Fasher after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces took control of the city in Sudan’s western Darfur region over the weekend.UK news | Downing Street has defended the prospect of paying more to house asylum seekers in disused barracks instead of hotels, arguing that quelling public disquiet was worth the extra cost. No 10 said that “communities don’t want asylum seekers housed in hotels, and neither does the government”.Middle East | Israeli warplanes struck Gaza on Tuesday night, shortly after Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, ordered the military to carry out “powerful strikes” in Gaza, in the most serious test of the increasingly shaky US-brokered ceasefire.Television | Prunella Scales, the actor best known for playing Sybil Fawlty in the classic comedy series Fawlty Towers, has died aged 93. Scales, who was married to fellow actor Timothy West, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2013. Continue reading...",

I know there’s a lot of interest in it. I think ultimately there’s an ability there for the Coalition to do this much better than Labor. Labor’s net zero [policy] has been a disaster …I think we could do net zero better than Labor in terms of emissions and cost and environmental protection, but you’ve got to keep net zero.I know that you probably find it all very interesting to talk about, but we do have a culture of openness in the Liberal party and the National party, and we seem to talk about a lot of things. I mean, frankly, I wonder what the nation will talk about if the Liberal party died, because I think we’d sort of run out of things to discuss.Communities around the country are trying to focus and talk about the issues that matter to them, not try to make some fake news thing out of a T-shirt the prime minister gets wearing off a plane. It’s ridiculous.Look, there’s a lot to legitimately criticise the prime minister about trillion dollar debt, skyrocketing house prices and job losses in our heavy industrial sector wearing a T-shirt is not one of them … So yeah, get on with acting on antisemitism.

Unlike Kohler’s Dekoda, which uses a camera to analyze your poop, the U-Scan detects and samples your urine, tests it using replaceable cartridges, and sends the results to the Withings app, where you’ll get tips on how to improve your health if needed.\n\nThe device is finally launching in the US and Europe today with two different cartridges. The U-Scan Nutrio monitors nutrition by measuring four urinary biomarkers — including hydration, ketones, and vitamin C — while the U-Scan Calci tracks parameters such as calcium levels to monitor kidney health and the potential for developing kidney stones. The cartridge for tracking reproductive health that was announced alongside the U-Scan at CES 2023 won’t be available at launch, and while the device was originally waiting for FDA clearance, Withings now classifies it as a “wellness product,” so clearance isn’t necessary.\n\nPricing starts at $349.95 for the Proactive option, which includes the U-Scan itself, a charging and cleaning station, access to the Withings Plus service, and a single Nutrio or Calci cartridge with 22 tests that will last up to three months with just two weekly measurements. The $429.95 Intensive option instead includes two cartridges and 44 tests, facilitating more tests per week. Replacement cartridges, which can be shipped regularly as part of a subscription plan, are $99.95 each or $179.95 a pair.",

      "link": "https://www.theverge.com/tech/635839/best-foldable-phone",
      "published": "2025-10-28T23:00:00",
      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\nA foldable phone isn’t for the faint of heart. They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. They’re also still not as durable as regular smartphones, though they’re not nearly as fragile as they once were. In fact, thanks to Google, we finally have a foldable phone we can take with us to the beach.\n\nThere are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.\n\n\n\nSo while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.\n\nIf I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.\n\nBest book-style foldable\nGoogle Pixel Pro 10 Fold\n\nScore: 8ProsConsFull dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnetsHeavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone\nWhere to Buy: $1799 at Amazon (256GB) $1799 at Best Buy (256GB) $1799 at Google (256GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;Google Tensor G5 /&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;5,015mAh /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) /&nbsp;Weather resistance:&nbsp;IP68\n\nDurability has long been the North Star of the foldable category, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold marks a real milestone in that journey. With an IP68 rating, it’s the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance. That means you can take the $1,799 device on a hike or to the beach without worrying that a stray grain of sand will absolutely destroy it. Add in Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging — along with Google’s more powerful Tensor G5 chip — and you have the most well-rounded foldable available.\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn’t without its shortcomings, though. It offers all-day battery life with minimal use of the inner display; however, if you spend most of your time using the inner screen, your battery will likely be in the red by bedtime. Also, while we love the device’s improved durability, its cameras fall short of Google’s other 10 Pro models, especially in low light. The foldable is a bit heavier and thicker than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, too, which is a fair trade for greater peace of mind.\n\nRead our full Pixel 10 Pro Fold review.\n\nBest flip-style foldable\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\n\nScore: 8ProsConsSamsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable cameraMore susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen\nWhere to Buy: $1099.99 at Amazon (256GB) $1099.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $1099.99 $1219.99 at Samsung (512GB)\nScreen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48\n\nThe latest Galaxy Z Flip may not be as fun as the newest Razr Ultra, but it does offer a few new tricks. Samsung ditched the old file-folder cover screen in favor of a glorious, 4.1-inch edge-to-edge panel that wraps around the cameras. The extra real estate means you have more room to quickly respond to messages or perform any task that doesn’t require you to open your phone (and risk getting lost in a digital rabbit hole).\n\nIn addition to the larger cover screen, the Flip 7 offers a couple of other thoughtful updates. It’s thinner than its predecessor and features a bigger 4,300mAh battery, which is a step up from the 4,000mAh battery found in the last-gen Flip 6. The camera system remains unchanged from last year’s model, too, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The 50-megapixel main shooter still produces great images, and you get all the versatility the flip form factor has to offer, including the ability to easily take selfies using the rear camera.\n\nDespite some welcome changes, the Flip 7 carries the same IP48 rating as last year’s model, which means long-term durability against fine dust particles remains a concern. However, Samsung offers a great warranty and repair program, along with seven years of OS and security updates. The Flip 7 isn’t perfect, but it’s the most powerful and polished version yet — just don’t drop it while lounging on the beach.\n\nRead our full Galaxy Z Flip 7 review.\n\nThe most fun foldable\nMotorola Razr Ultra (2025)\n\nScore: 7ProsConsOne of the best-looking phones you can buyGreat battery lifeOuter screen is useful in unexpected waysAI button is wasted real estate Long-term durability is still a question markCamera processing is occasionally weird\nWhere to Buy: $1299.99 $1099.99 at Amazon (512GB) $1299.99 $1099.99 at Best Buy (512GB) $1299.99 $1099.99 at Motorola (512GB)\nScreen: 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48\n\nThe Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.\n\nBeyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus. While the Ultra is enjoyable, it can’t overcome the gripes we’ve had with previous Motorola foldables, like inconsistent camera processing. Meanwhile, Motorola is only promising three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which is on the shorter side considering the $1,300 retail price.\n\nRead our full Razr Ultra (2025) review.\n\nThe best battery life in a foldable\nOppo Find N5\n\nScore: 8ProsConsIt’s really, really thinExcellent battery lifeThe crease is almost invisibleFoldables are still fragileIt’s not launching in the US or Europe\nWhere to Buy: $2499 $2099 at Oppo (512GB)\nScreen: 8.12-inch, 2248p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.62-inch, 1140p, 120Hz OLED outer screen size/ Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.9 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 8-megapixel selfie cameras (inner and outer) / Battery: 5,600mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IPX8/IPX9\n\nLet’s get the bad news out of the way first: if you live in the US or Europe, you can’t buy the Oppo Find N5. That rules out, well, a lot of us. But if you live in China, Singapore, or any of the other Asian countries Oppo included in its so-called “global” release, then you’re in luck: you can pick up one of the world’s thinnest book-style folding phones, and the rest of us are all very jealous of you.\n\nThe Find N5 isn’t all about thinness, either. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is highly capable, the phone is fully water-resistant, and battery life is excellent. It utilizes silicon-carbon battery technology to accommodate a large (by foldable standards) 5,600mAh battery, which easily holds up after a long day of heavy use. What’s even more impressive is that, like the aforementioned Z Fold 7, the Find N5 is still barely thicker than a standard slab-style phone and only slightly heavier. That matters when you’re using the phone via the cover screen for long periods of time or stashing it in the side pocket of your yoga pants. When a foldable is only about as heavy and bulky as a regular phone, using the inner screen feels like getting away with something fantastic — not a benefit you have to make many other sacrifices for. Oppo delivers this in spades, and I just wish more of us could… find it.\n\nRead our full Oppo Find N5 review.\n\nOther foldables to consider\n\n\nThe latest Huawei Mate XTs gets an honorable mention for its sheer wow factor alone. It’s Huawei’s second trifold phone and features some minor upgrades over the original, which we found to be a great foldable that’s far too expensive. The second-gen Mate XTs is cheaper than the original at 17,999 yuan (about $2,520) and adds several new features, including stylus support, an upgraded Kirin 9020 chipset, and an improved 40-megapixel ultrawide.\n\n\n\nThe Motorola Razr Plus 2025 is new to the scene, replacing last year’s model. Although the two devices look identical, there are a few notable changes. The biggest difference is that the Razr Plus 2025 now features a titanium hinge, rather than stainless steel, promising better durability and a less noticeable crease when the device is open. Additionally, the Razr Plus 2025 offers IP48 dust and water resistance, whereas last year’s model featured an IPX8 rating. While we haven’t tested the newest model, it appears to be a solid alternative to the Ultra.\n\n\n\nThe standard Motorola Razr 2025 is a more affordable entry point into the world of foldables, starting at $699. The Razr 2025 offers improved performance, battery life, and durability — the kind of bumps we expect year after year. It boasts a smaller cover screen compared to the Razr Plus and Ultra, but still offers a spacious 6.9-inch internal display. We haven’t tested the Razr 2025 yet, but its relatively budget-friendly price is a good option for jumping into the foldable market.\n\n\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is an impressive sophomore effort from Google, offering an ideal form factor that’s a joy to use. When folded, the outer screen matches the dimensions of a regular phone, and the inner screen can get nice and bright outdoors. The whole package is also light enough that it sometimes doesn’t feel like you’re holding a foldable, though it does suffer from a slightly downgraded camera system compared to its slab-style siblings. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so long-term durability remains a concern. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 is an excellent alternative to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The slim, lightweight foldable is just 8.9mm thick when folded shut, which is nearly as slim as standard slab-style devices. It has a spacious inner display that’s great for multitasking, and the battery can last a full day with moderate use. That being said, the Z Fold 7 has a starting price of $1,999 and doesn’t offer full dust and water resistance, making the hinge more susceptible to damage. Read our review.\n\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nSamsung has been teasing a trifold device for months, and the company says it’s still on track to launch later this year. In fact, it recently showed off a prototype version of the hardware. Instead of folding in an accordion-style like the Huawei Mate XTs, Samsung’s trifold will seemingly feature a middle portion and two sides that fold inward. Beyond that, Samsung has yet to share details, such as what the trifold will be called or how much it will cost. Considering the Z Fold 7 has a starting price of $1,999, we’re bracing ourselves for the announcement.\n\nUpdate, October 28th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added the Pixel 10 Pro Fold as our top pick.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced the GUARD Act on Tuesday, which would also ban everyone under 18 from accessing AI chatbots, as reported earlier by NBC News. \n\nThe bill comes just weeks after safety advocates and parents attended a Senate hearing to call attention to the impact of AI chatbots on kids. Under the legislation, AI companies would have to verify ages by requiring users to upload their government ID or provide validation through another “reasonable” method, which might include something like face scans.\n\nAI chatbots would be required to disclose that they aren’t human at 30-minute intervals under the bill. They would also have to include safeguards that prevent them from claiming that they are a human, similar to an AI safety bill recently passed in California. The bill would make it illegal to operate a chatbot that produces sexual content for minors or promotes suicide, too.\n\n“Our legislation imposes strict safeguards against exploitative or manipulative AI, backed by tough enforcement with criminal and civil penalties,” Blumenthal says in a statement provided to The Verge. “Big Tech has betrayed any claim that we should trust companies to do the right thing on their own when they consistently put profit first ahead of child safety.”",

      "content": "On Tuesday, Westinghouse announced that it had reached an agreement with the Trump administration that would purportedly see $80 billion of new nuclear reactors built in the US. And the government indicated that it had finalized plans for a collaboration of GE Vernova and Hitachi to build additional reactors. Unfortunately, there are roughly zero details about the deal at the moment.\nThe agreements were apparently negotiated during President Trump’s trip to Japan. An announcement of those agreements indicates that “Japan and various Japanese companies” would invest “up to” $332 billion for energy infrastructure. This specifically mentioned Westinghouse, GE Vernova, and Hitachi. This promises the construction of both large AP1000 reactors and small modular nuclear reactors. The announcement then goes on to indicate that many other companies would also get a slice of that “up to $332 billion,” many for basic grid infrastructure.\nSo the total amount devoted to nuclear reactors is not specified in the announcement or anywhere else. As of the publication time, the Department of Energy has no information on the deal; Hitachi, GE Vernova, and the Hitachi/GE Vernova collaboration websites are also silent on it.Read full article\nComments",

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\nYouTube is updating its policy to age-restrict more content containing video game scenes with “graphic violence,” the company announced on Tuesday. The update will go into effect on November 17th and will prevent accounts under 18 and signed-out users from watching videos with games focused on showing “realistic human characters” involved in scenes of “mass violence against non-combatants” or torture.\n\nWhen choosing whether to restrict a video, YouTube says it will take the length of the graphic scene into account, as well as whether it’s zoomed in or the main focus of a scene. It will also evaluate whether the video shows violence targeted at a character “that looks like a real human.” YouTube’s post doesn’t clarify if this applies to the violence seen in games like Grand Theft Auto, a Call of Duty sequence like the infamous “No Russian” mission, or other kinds of realistically rendered scenes.\n\nHowever, YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle said in a statement to The Verge that “certain content may be age-restricted if it&#8217;s non-fleeting or zoomed in,” adding that “there may be ways the creator can choose to play the mission to avoid content that would lead to an age restriction.” Creators can also choose to blur or obscure the violence, according to Bullwinkle.\n\nThe update builds upon YouTube’s existing policies, which state that the platform may restrict videos featuring “dramatized violence” focused on torture, severe injuries, or violent deaths with blood, with an exception for games. The current policy says, “Generally, we do not remove dramatized violence when the content or metadata lets us know that the content is fictional, or when it’s apparent from the content itself, such as with animated content or video games.”\n\n“YouTube’s policies are designed to adapt to the evolving digital world, and these updates reflect our ongoing commitment to protect younger users and foster a responsible platform,” Bullwinkle said.\n\nIn addition to stricter policies surrounding video games, the update will also prevent creators from directing users to online gambling content involving digital goods, like video game skins, cosmetics, or NFTs. YouTube stopped allowing creators to verbally mention or display online gambling services not approved by Google in March. The platform started blocking approved online gambling content for users under 18 at this time, and now it’s planning to age-restrict social casino content as well.\n\nUpdate, October 28th: Added clarification from YouTube.",

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\tNew World: Aeternum.\t\n\nAs part of Amazon’s mass layoffs announced today, the company is making “significant” changes to its gaming division, including halting much of its work on first-party AAA MMOs, according to a memo from Steve Boom, VP of audio, Twitch, and games.&nbsp;\n\n“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Boom said in the memo, which Amazon shared with The Verge.\n\nThe developers of New World: Aeternum, one of Amazon’s MMOs, have already announced plans to stop providing new content updates. The team said it&#8217;s not sunsetting the game “at this time” and that “servers will be live through 2026.” The developers will provide “a minimum of six months’ notice before making any changes that impact your ability” to play the game.\n\nAmazon also publishes the MMOs Throne and Liberty, which is developed by NCSoft and FirstSpark Games, and Lost Ark, developed by Smilegate RPG. “We will continue supporting Throne and Liberty and Lost Ark with regular updates and community engagement,” Amazon spokesperson Brittney Hefner told The Verge. They’ll get new content updates for the foreseeable future, Hefner confirmed.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon announced that it would be developing a Lord of the Rings MMO in partnership with Embracer Group. Amazon and Embracer didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about that game.\n\nLast year, Amazon canceled a planned Western release of the Bandai Namco-developed MMO Blue Protocol, which was shuttered in Japan in January.\n\nAmazon isn’t fully pulling back on its work in games. Boom pointed to the launch of the revamped Luna and said that its Studio 5 team, which developed a courtroom game with an AI Snoop Dogg for the cloud gaming service, will “continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna.” He also said Luna is a “great example” of “how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon” because it “leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members.”\n\nIn addition, Boom highlighted a “successful closed alpha” for the MOBA March of Giants and noted that Amazon is still working with Crystal Dynamics on a new Tomb Raider game (Amazon is also making a Tomb Raider series) and with Maverick Games on a new open-world driving game.\n\nYou can read Boom’s full memo below.&nbsp;\n\n\nDear Games Team,\n\n\n\nThis morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.\n\n\n\nWhile these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming Tomb Raider title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams. Most countries with impacted employees have been notified. Our other global hubs will follow local processes and be notified at a later date.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is no getting around the fact that days like this are hard, and we will be losing team members whose work and dedication have had an incredible impact on our customers over the years. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and yet they are necessary for us to continue to drive our business forward.\n\n\n\nPlease reach out directly to your manager or to your HRBP with any specific questions.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\nSteve\n\n\nUpdates, October 28th: Added details from the New World: Aeternum team and from Amazon about two of its other MMOs.",

These open-ear-style earbuds rest securely in your outer ear rather than inside of your ear canals, allowing you to more easily hear what’s going on around you at all times. Right now, they’re matching their all-time low of $99 ($50 off) at Amazon with a Prime membership and Nothing’s online storefront.\nNothing Ear Open\n\nWhere to Buy: $149 $99 at Amazon (with Prime) $149 $99 at Nothing\nThe Nothing Ear Open join the growing market of open-ear options, which also includes the pricier Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 and Bose Ultra Open. These models all feature designs that prioritize safety over sound quality. Rather than forming a seal in your ear for passive sound isolation, Nothing’s wireless earbuds always let ambient noise in. For runners and cyclists, that means being able to hear vehicles, pedestrians, and other potential hazards. That being said, if you wear glasses like I do, the over-the-ear style can sometimes be difficult to wear with thicker frames, so that’s something to keep in mind.\n\nAlthough Nothing’s earbuds can’t match the audio quality of modern in-ear models, the design of each speaker module helps minimize sound leakage. Meanwhile, each earbud includes a pair of microphones and Nothing’s latest noise-canceling technology, so your voice should sound crystal clear during phone calls. The earbuds also support multipoint Bluetooth and a “Low Lag Mode” for gaming, which can automatically activate if you own a Nothing Phone. Otherwise, you can activate the mode through Nothing’s mobile app.\n\nWhen it comes to battery life, Nothing says the earbuds get up to eight hours on a full charge, with a total of 30 hours with the charging case. Unfortunately, the case doesn’t support wireless charging, though a quick 10-minute charge over USB-C should provide two hours of listening time.",

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\tGarmins aren’t just multisport behemoths anymore. | Illustration by Will Joel / The Verge\t\n\nFew brands are as synonymous with outdoor sports as Garmin. You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’t just for athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone.\n\nIf you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and last weeks on a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, and the company announced in March that it would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years&nbsp;publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra.\n\n\n\nGarmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, and several Garmins released since 2023 have an FDA-cleared EKG feature. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem.\n\nThere are a lot of Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction.\n\nThe best Garmin for runners\nGarmin Forerunner 265 / 265S\nGarmin’s midrange Forerunner watch has an OLED display, a week’s worth of battery life, and dual-frequency GPS for better accuracy.\n\nScore: 9ProsConsMore intuitive menu navigationMultiband GPSLong battery life — even with AOD enabledAdds helpful training featuresOh, oh, it’s OLED, you knowIt’s $100 more than the 255OLED displays don’t cost $100\nWhere to Buy: $449.99 at Amazon $449.99 at Best Buy $449.99 at Garmin\nSizes: 42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\n\nGarmin has many running watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, and battery life. Its vibrant OLED display also impressed us. We got about a week on a single charge with always-on display enabled, and up to 15 days with that setting turned off. \n\nThe 265 has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band), which gets you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. You don’t lose a whole lot of battery life with dual-frequency GPS enabled. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600.\n\nMy main complaint is that $450 (outside of a deal, at least), while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider the Forerunner 165 series. It starts at $249.99 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered.\nGarmin Forerunner 165 Music\nThe Garmin Forerunner 165 Music gets you in-depth training metrics but leaves out some of the more advanced features in exchange for a more palatable price.\n\nWhere to Buy: $299.99 at Amazon $299.99 at Garmin $300 at REI\nNeither has all of Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.)\n\nOn the other hand, if your budget allows, you could also consider the Forerunner 570 and  Forerunner 970, which were released in June and cost $549.99 and $749.99, respectively. Both models have a built-in speaker and microphone, OLED screen, skin temperature sensors, flashlight, and built-in EKG reader with atrial fibrillation detection. They also give you a daily evening report with suggestions on how much sleep you should get, plus a digest of your upcoming events, workouts, and the weather. You also get access to Garmin Coach, a free multipart workout program, which allows you to upload your course and receive notifications when you’ve hit certain distance benchmarks. \n\nWhile both smartwatches have a lot in common, they do have some key differences, the main being that the 970 has maps. The Forerunner 570 comes in 42mm and 47mm sizes, and Garmin says its battery lasts up to 10 or 11 days based on which model you pick  (with the always-on display off.) The Forerunner 970 only comes in a 47mm size, and Garmin says it can last up to 15 days per charge. The Forerunner 970 also includes three exclusive metrics: running tolerance, running economy, and speed step loss. \n\nThese three tools will give you a weekly maximum mileage recommendation (with the option to adjust it up or down), and assess running efficiency. The running economy and step speed loss features require Garmin’s $169.99 HRM 600 heart rate monitor.\n\nThe Forerunner 570 is a definite step up from the Forerunner 265, but not a big enough leap to recommend it to everyone instead of that model, especially because it doesn’t offer offline maps. The Forerunner 970 may be overkill for all but the most avid runners, but it’s good to see Garmin continually adding new features to the top of its line. \n\nRead my full Garmin Forerunner 265S review.\n\nThe best Garmin for endurance sports\nGarmin Epix Pro Sapphire Edition (42mm)\nThe Garmin Epix Pro comes in three sizes, includes a handy flashlight, and has multiband GPS.

You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is that the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix.\nGarmin Fenix 8\nThe Garmin Fenix 8 adds smart features like the ability to take calls on the wrist, and an on-board voice assistant.\n\nScore: 7ProsConsSmartens up Garmin’s flagship multisport watchExcellent battery and fitness trackingOffers MIP and OLED display optionsCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into oneThe starting price is $350 more than the Fenix 7!Smart features are less helpful without LTE\nWhere to Buy: $999.99 at Garmin $1000 at REI $999.99 at Amazon\nThat said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro, Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, and now, the Fenix 8. The main difference is that the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED screens is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue.\n\nNot helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED and an MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is that the starting price is now $350 more (barring any deals) than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is that the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available.\n\nBut really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features.\n\nWe haven’t had a chance to get our hands on it yet, but Garmin also recently announced the&nbsp;Fenix 8 Pro. The watch, which starts at $1,199.99, is available in 47mm and 51mm sizes with either an OLED or MicroLED display. All models feature LTE and satellite connectivity, which costs $7.99 a month and allows you to send text and voice messages through the Garmin Messenger app when your phone is unavailable. The expanded connectivity also enables LiveTrack location sharing and access to real-time weather forecasts, as well as SOS requests, which get routed to  Garmin’s Response Center and emergency services in the event of an emergency.\nGarmin Fenix 7S Pro\nLike the Garmin Epix Pro, the Fenix 7 Pro line has an updated optical heart rate sensor for improved accuracy. It also has excellent battery life, a slightly brighter MIP display, solar charging, and the option of upgrading to sapphire crystal.\n\nScore: 8ProsConsHands-free flashlightLong battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate monitorThe improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lightingToo similar to the standard Fenix 7\nWhere to Buy: $899.99 $730.33 at Amazon $899.99 $749.99 at Best Buy $899.99 at Garmin\nIf you’re set on getting the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes, and costs around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8’s smart features are a bit half-baked.\n\nRead my full Epix Pro review.\n\nThe best Garmin for those on a budget\nGarmin Vivomove Sport\nGarmin’s entry-level hybrid smartwatch looks like a Swatch at first glance. However, it sports a hidden OLED display that delivers notifications without sacrificing fitness tracking.\n\nScore: 8ProsConsAesthetically pleasing and accurate trackingGood for smaller wristsAffordable priceThe hidden OLED is coolThe Garmin app is overly complicatedBattery life is shorter than other hybrids\nWhere to Buy: $179.99 $174.99 at Amazon $179.99 at Garmin\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 19g / Battery life: Up to 5 days / Display type: “Hidden” OLED touchscreen / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\n\nWhat I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn’t look like what most people expect from a Garmin. It’s a hybrid smartwatch, which means it looks like a regular watch but can track fitness and deliver notifications. Garmin’s hybrids are also unique in that they all use an OLED display that stays hidden until you need it.\n\nThis is best suited for a casually active person who wants style and value in a lightweight package. Think wellness, more so than fitness. It gets you continuous heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring, and can even provide abnormal heart rate alerts. You also get access to more in-depth metrics like respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and Body Battery, which is Garmin’s tool for visualizing how well-rested you are. For smart features, you get all the basics, like notifications, alarms, and timers.\n\nThe Sport isn’t quite as full-featured as some other Garmin watches you’ll find on this list. For instance, you’re giving up built-in GPS in favor of tethered GPS through your phone. There are no contactless payments, nor is there a microphone or speaker for taking calls on the wrist. But this is a budget pick, and you get a lot, considering this is an entry-level gadget that could pass for a Swatch at a glance.\n\nI don’t love that the battery life is short for a hybrid, at around three to four days. Even so, that’s still much better than what you’ll get on a recent Apple Watch or Android watch running Wear OS 5 or 6. If you’re willing to spend about $100 more, the $269.99 Vivomove Trend has more chic materials, gets you more screen real estate, and wireless Qi charging. Otherwise, this is a great lifestyle wearable that can serve as a classier alternative to your typical fitness band.\nGarmin Lily 2\nThe Garmin Lily 2 is a simple yet chic hybrid analog smartwatch that delivers basic fitness tracking, notifications, and up to five days of battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy: $249.99 $199.99 at Amazon $249.99 $199.99 at Best Buy $249.99 at Garmin\nIf you prefer something newer to the Sport that’s also stylish, the Garmin Lily 2 is another good option, especially if you’ve got particularly small wrists or prefer something extremely lightweight. The swipe and tap gestures are still a little fiddly to use — which was also the case with the first-gen model — but the fresh design is a fun way to lightly monitor your fitness without bogging yourself down with notifications. Garmin also offers the Lily 2 Active, which adds a physical button, GPS, and support for more sports tracking for a starting price of $299.99.\n\nRead my full Garmin Vivomove Sport review.\n\nThe best Garmin to replace a Fitbit\nGarmin Venu Sq 2\nThe Garmin Venu Sq 2 is a great replacement for a Fitbit smartwatch. Not only do they look similar, but the Venu Sq 2 has way more fitness features, long battery life, and no subscription.\n\nScore: 8ProsConsBright displayLong battery lifeTons of training and health featuresCluttered appProprietary USB-A charger\nWhere to Buy: $249.99 $184.9 at Amazon $249.99 at Garmin\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 38g / Battery life: Up to 11 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 4GB (for Music Edition)\n\nIf you were disappointed by the Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4, the Venu Sq 2 is the next best thing (and, in some ways, better).\n\nAt a glance, the Venu Sq 2 could easily be mistaken for an Apple Watch. On the wrist, you’ll notice it’s made of plastic, but it still looks quite chic and extremely lightweight. The screen is bright, easy to read, and looks better than any Versa or Sense ever did.\n\nThe feature set is also great for the price, with built-in GPS, a ton of watch faces, emergency safety features, and contactless payments. If you pay $50 more for the Music Edition, you’ll also get enough storage to hold about 500 songs, but we wouldn’t recommend it. This watch doesn’t have cellular connectivity and, therefore, isn’t truly standalone. You’ll most likely be carrying your phone with you anyway.\n\nAs for health features, the Venu Sq 2 basically has everything you’d get on a Versa or Sense smartwatch but with Garmin’s treasure trove of metrics as well. That includes heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, intensity minutes (how much moderate exercise you get in a week), stress tracking, hydration tracking, respiratory rate, period tracking, and Garmin’s recovery feature, Body Battery. As far as fitness goes, you also get access to Garmin Coach, which provides free 5K, 10K, and half marathon training plans. You love to see it.\n\nAnother big leg-up Garmin has over Fitbit? None of these features or metrics are locked behind a paywall, even if Garmin’s AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features are only available as part of Garmin Connect Plus ($6.99 a month / $69.99 annually).\n\nRead my full Garmin Venu Sq 2 review.\n\nThe best Garmin smartwatch\nGarmin Venu 3S\nThe Garmin Venu 3S adds a heart rate sensor, a wheelchair mode, and much-improved sleep tracking and nap detection. \n\nScore: 7ProsConsGood battery lifeBetter sleep tracking and nap detectionEKG and AFib featuresCan take calls and use your phone’s voice assistantAudio meditation sessions done wellPricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatchesLimited third-party app ecosystemNo LTE capability\nWhere to Buy: $449.99 $384.95 at Amazon $449.99 $384.95 at Walmart $449.99 $384.99 at Best Buy\nSizes: 41mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 / Battery life: Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\n\nGarmin has shored up the smarts in its watches over the past several years, and the Venu 3 series is one of the smartest (and most affordable) of the bunch.\n\nThe Venu 3 series comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like the Venu 2 Plus, it has a microphone and speaker. You can take calls directly from the wrist and issue commands to your phone’s digital assistant via Bluetooth. It’s not the same as having Siri, Bixby, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant built directly into the watch, but it’s a clever workaround that works well for hands-free control. It also supports safety features like fall detection and live tracking, as well as contactless payments.\n\nLike other OLED Garmins, the display is both vibrant and easy to read. As for health and fitness, you get a nice mix of basic and more advanced features and metrics. It has a heart rate sensor that enables FDA-cleared EKG and AFib detection features. Overall, it leans a bit more on the wellness and health side of things, with intensity minutes, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and stress tracking. As for training, you still get built-in GPS, VO2 Max, heart rate zones, respiration rate, and downloadable training plans via Garmin Coach.\n\nThe Venu 3 and 3S have a sleep coach that factors in metrics like heart rate variability and recent activity to determine your sleep needs. It also adds nap detection, a feature that’s been long overdue for the Garmin platform, and audio-guided meditation sessions. From an accessibility standpoint, this also adds a wheelchair mode.\n\nTechnically, the Fenix 8 is slightly smarter in that it has an onboard voice assistant. However, it is also more than double the price and not what I’d consider a good value for the average athlete. It’s more for people who spend hours upon hours training every week.\n\nThis is the Garmin for you if you want the platform’s in-depth training without sacrificing the productivity of a smartwatch. The main features it’s lacking are cellular options and a robust third-party app ecosystem. That said, it’s got Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer for offline listening. It’s also a good option if you’re fed up with MIP displays and want a smarter Garmin rather than a full-on smartwatch.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Garmin recently launched the Garmin Venu 4. The new model is available in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm, both of which are available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Garmin for $549.99. The smartwatch features more advanced wellness features than the Venu 3, including the ability to log your caffeine and alcohol intake, providing insights into how they may be impacting your sleep. Garmin’s Fitness Coach can also create a personalized workout regimen from a pool of 25 exercises, which are based on your prior performance, recovery level, and recent sleep patterns.\n\nRead my full Garmin Venu 3S review.\n\nUpdate, October 28th: Adjusted pricing and availability.

      "content": "Is it possible to be a CEO in 2025 and not catch a case of AI fever? The latest company to catch this particular cold is Lucid, the Saudi-backed electric vehicle startup. Today, it announced a new collaboration with Nvidia to use the latter’s hardware and software, with the aim of creating an autonomous vehicle for consumers. Oh, and the AI will apparently design Lucid’s production lines.\nFormed by refugees from Tesla who saw a chance to improve on their past work, Lucid has already built the most efficient EV on sale in North America. But until recently, it also just had variants of the same Air sedan to offer consumers, before the Gravity SUV joined the range this year.\nThe company will need to start selling tens of thousands of EVs a year before too long, especially if it’s ever to become profitable. And that will involve some smaller, cheaper models, starting with a midsize crossover sometime in 2027. A major goal for the first of those EVs is a starting price of less than $50,000, so I hope they’re getting a good deal on the Nvidia GPUs that Lucid now says will enable a “true eyes-off, hands-off, and mind-off” autonomous driving system for consumer-owned vehicles.Read full article\nComments",

      "content": "An AI language model like the kind that powers ChatGPT is a gigantic statistical web of data relationships. You give it a prompt (such as a question), and it provides a response that is statistically related and hopefully helpful. At first, ChatGPT was a tech amusement, but now hundreds of millions of people are relying on this statistical process to guide them through life’s challenges. It’s the first time in history that large numbers of people have begun to confide their feelings to a talking machine, and mitigating the potential harm the systems can cause has been an ongoing challenge.\nOn Monday, OpenAI released data estimating that 0.15 percent of ChatGPT’s active users in a given week have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent. It’s a tiny fraction of the overall user base, but with more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to over a million people each week, reports TechCrunch.\nOpenAI also estimates that a similar percentage of users show heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT, and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the chatbot.Read full article\nComments",

      "published": "2025-10-28T15:17:13",
      "content": "As newer, more efficient silicon manufacturing processes have gotten more expensive and difficult to develop, chipmakers like Intel and AMD have repeatedly rebranded some of their older processors with new model numbers. This has allowed both companies to release “new” products that aren’t actually new at all, muddying the waters for people trying to buy lower-end and midrange laptops.\nAs spotted by Tom’s Hardware, AMD has quietly rebranded a swath of its Ryzen laptop chips with new model numbers without changing the silicon. The rebranded processors use either Rembrandt-R silicon with Zen 3+ CPU cores and RDNA 2 graphics cores or Mendocino silicon with Zen 2 CPU cores and RDNA 2 graphics cores. Both of these architectures first launched in 2022, but Mendocino’s Zen 2 CPU architecture dates all the way back to 2019. During the company’s model number decoder ring era, these designs had been sold as Ryzen 7035- and Ryzen 7020-series chips, respectively.\nThis is actually AMD’s second rebranding for the Rembrandt-R silicon, which was launched as the Ryzen 6000 series in 2022. These chips will compete most directly with Intel’s non-Ultra Core 100 series processors, most of which use 2022-vintage Raptor Lake silicon.Read full article\nComments",

      "published": "2025-10-28T15:02:30",
      "content": "On Monday, Microsoft and OpenAI announced a revised partnership agreement that introduces an independent expert panel to verify when OpenAI achieves so-called artificial general intelligence (AGI), a determination that will trigger major shifts in how the companies share technology and revenue. The deal values Microsoft’s stake in OpenAI at approximately $135 billion and extends the exclusive partnership through 2032 while giving both companies more freedom to pursue AGI independently.\nThe partnership began in 2019 when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI. Since then, Microsoft has provided billions in cloud computing resources through Azure and used OpenAI’s models as the basis of products like Copilot. The new agreement maintains Microsoft as OpenAI’s frontier model partner and preserves Microsoft’s exclusive rights to OpenAI’s IP and Azure API exclusivity until the threshold of AGI is reached.\nUnder a previous arrangement, OpenAI alone would determine when it achieved AGI, which is a nebulous concept that is difficult to define. The revised deal requires an independent expert panel to verify that claim, a change that adds oversight to a determination with billions of dollars at stake. When the panel confirms that AGI has been reached, Microsoft’s intellectual property rights to OpenAI’s research methods will expire, and the revenue-sharing arrangement between the companies will end, though payments will continue over a longer period.Read full article\nComments",

      "content": "On Friday, the California Supreme Court ordered the University of California system to release the details of a proposed deal from the federal government that would restore research grants that were suspended by the Trump administration. The proposed deal, first issued in August, had remained confidential as a suit filed by faculty at UCLA made its way through appeals. With California’s top court now weighing in, the university administrators have released the document, still marked “draft” and “confidential attorney work product.”\nMost of the demands will seem unsurprising to those familiar with the Trump administration’s interest: an end to all diversity programs and those supporting transgender individuals, plus a sharp crackdown on campus protests. The eye-opening portion comes at the price tag of nearly $1.2 billion paid out, with UCLA covering all the costs of compliance. And, as written, the deal wouldn’t stop the Trump administration from cutting the grants for other reasons or imposing more intrusive regulations, such as those mentioned in its university compact.\nFamiliar concerns\nIn many ways, the proposed deal is much more focused than the odd list of demands the administration sent Harvard University earlier this year, in that it targets issues that the administration has focused on repeatedly. These include an end to all diversity programs at both the faculty and student levels. It demands that UCLA agree to “remove explicit or implicit goals for compositional diversity based on race, sex, or ethnicity, including eliminating any secretive or proxy-based ‘diversity’ hiring processes.”Read full article\nComments",
