Maybe the most gobsmacking detail about the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu from HMP Chelmsford was this, from a delivery driver who was delivering equipment to the prison as he left: Kebatu, who was serving a sentence for sexual assault and was due to be deported, appeared baffled as he walked free, and lingered outside the gates for an hour and a half before heading away. “They [the officers] were basically sending him away, saying, ‘Go, you’ve been released, you go,’” the driver told Sky News. “He kept scratching his head and saying, ‘Where do I go, where do I go?’”On its face, that might look like incompetence. But the fiasco of Kebatu’s release may point to much bigger issues in the prison system. Yesterday, the justice secretary, David Lammy blamed “human error” – while the Prison Officers’ Association (POA) called the suspension of a single officer “unjust”.Hurrican Melissa | Jamaicans have started to take shelter from Hurricane Melissa as the category 5 storm neared the coast amid warnings of catastrophic flooding, landslides and extensive infrastructure damage.

      "published": "2025-10-28T00:46:59",
      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\nxAI’s Grokipedia, its Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia, is now live. The similarities go deeper than expected.\n\nGrokipedia’s design is pretty basic right now; like Wikipedia, the homepage is mostly just a big search bar, and entries resemble very basic Wikipedia entries, with headings, subheadings, and citations. I haven’t seen any photos on the site yet. Wikipedia lets users edit pages, but it doesn’t appear that users can currently do that on Grokipedia; a big edit button at the top only appeared on a few pages for me, and when I clicked the button, it only showed edits that had already been completed without specifying who is actually suggested or made the changes, and I wasn’t able to suggest changes of my own.&nbsp;\n\nEntries also claim that Grok has fact-checked them — a controversial idea, given how large language models tend to make up false “facts” — and how long ago the “fact check” happened.\n\nHowever, despite Elon Musk promising that Grokipedia would be a “massive improvement” over Wikipedia, some articles appear to be cribbing information from Wikipedia. At the bottom of the page for the MacBook Air, for example, you can see this message: “The content is adapted from Wikipedia, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License.” In some cases, the cribbing goes farther than a rewrite: I’ve also seen that message on pages for the PlayStation 5 and the Lincoln Mark VIII, and both of those pages are almost identical — word-for-word, line-for-line — to their Wikipedia counterparts.\n\n“Even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist,” Lauren Dickinson, a spokesperson for the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit that operates Wikipedia tells The Verge. You can read Dickinson’s full statement in full at the end of this article.\n\nIt’s not the first time xAI’s AI has been caught pointing to Wikipedia; last month, in response to an X user pointing out that Grok cites Wikipedia pages, Musk said that “we should have this fixed by end of year.”\n\nNot all Grokipedia articles are based directly on Wikipedia ones, and some will be controversial.&nbsp;\n\nWhile both sites have articles on climate change, for example, Wikipedia’s page points out that “There is a nearly unanimous scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.”&nbsp;\n\nIn Grokipedia’s entry, meanwhile, the word “unanimous” only appears in one paragraph: “Critics contend that claims of near-unanimous scientific consensus on anthropogenic causes dominating recent climate change overstate agreement due to selective categorization in literature reviews.” It suggests that the media and advocacy organizations like Greenpeace are “contributing to heightened public alarm,” and are part of “coordinated efforts to frame the issue as an existential imperative, influencing public discourse and policy without always grounding in proportionate empirical evidence.”\n\nAccording to a ticker at the bottom of the homepage, Grokipedia has over 885,000 articles; Wikipedia currently maintains around 7 million English pages. However, this is an early version of Grokipedia — it has a v0.1 version number on the homepage.\n\nHere is Dickinson’s full statement:\n\n\nWe’re still in the process of understanding how Grokipedia works.\n\n\n\nSince 2001, Wikipedia has been the backbone of knowledge on the internet. Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, it remains the only top website in the world run by a nonprofit. Unlike newer projects, Wikipedia’s strengths are clear: it has transparent policies, rigorous volunteer oversight, and a strong culture of continuous improvement. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, written to inform billions of readers without promoting a particular point of view.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWikipedia’s knowledge is – and always will be – human. Through open collaboration and consensus, people from all backgrounds build a neutral, living record of human understanding – one that reflects our diversity and collective curiosity. This human-created knowledge is what AI companies rely on to generate content; even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWikipedia’s nonprofit independence — with no ads and no data-selling — also sets it apart from for-profit alternatives. All of these strengths have kept Wikipedia a top trusted resource for more than two decades.\n\n\n\nMany experiments to create alternative versions of Wikipedia have happened before; it doesn’t interfere with our work or mission. As we approach Wikipedia’s 25th anniversary, Wikipedia will continue focusing on providing free, trustworthy knowledge built by its dedicated volunteer community.

      "published": "2025-10-27T23:49:20",
      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\nCan you believe that the holiday season is already creeping up on us? I can’t. But at least that means we can begin looking forward to all the deals we’re likely to see during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the bulk of which will drop on November 28th. Everything from gaming gear and headphones to the latest smart home tech — well, almost everything — will be on sale, including plenty of Verge favorites.\n\nBut be aware: some of the best deals will only be available for Amazon Prime subscribers. Fortunately, if you’re interested in all of Amazon’s discounted goodies but haven’t signed up for Prime, don’t worry — Amazon makes it very easy to lock in a premium account.\n\nIf you’re attracted by the goodies being offered but haven’t signed up for Prime, Amazon makes it very easy\n\nBesides giving access to Prime Day bargains, Amazon includes a bunch of features to entice people to sign up for its Prime service. These include access to its streaming video service, Prime Video, which sadly is no longer ad-free, though you can pay extra for that; free and faster shipping on purchases (with two-day or one-day delivery for many items and even same-day delivery for some); discounts on a selection of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods groceries along with a free GrubHub Plus membership; Amazon Music ad-free audio streaming (not to be confused with the more extensive Amazon Music Unlimited, which is an additional $10.99 per month for Prime members and $11.99 per month for non-members); free access to Amazon Luna gaming; unlimited photo storage (along with 5GB of video storage); and Prime Reading, which gives you access to a rotating library of comics, books, and magazines as well as early access to a curated selection of new books. Amazon also added discounts at BP and Amaco gas stations last year.\n\nYou can share your Prime account with one other adult, up to four children, and up to four teens (as long as they were added before April 7th, 2025) using the Amazon Family program. Shared benefits include fast delivery, Prime streaming access, purchased ebooks and other media, and early access to lightning deals. (Some features, such as Music Prime, are not shared.) \n\nHere’s how to sign up.\n\nChoose a plan\n\n\nGo to https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime and scroll down to where it says Choose your plan. You can immediately click on the button that says Start your free 30-day trial if you want, but don’t you want to see what your options are first?\n\n\n\nChoose which plan you want. The basic plan lets you sign up for the service for $14.99 per month or $139 per year, which comes out to a little over $12 a month. \n\n\n\nPrime for Young Adults is for anyone who is between the ages of 18 and 24 or can verify that they are an enrolled student. You’ll get a free six-month trial subscription (if you’re a new member), and after that, you’ll only have to pay $7.49 a month or $69 a year. \n\n\n\nIf you’re on any of a variety of government assistance programs, like SNAP and Medicaid, you can also join for less with Prime Access: $6.99 a month with a free 30-day trial.\n\n\n\nIs it your birthday soon? If you have a generous friend or relative, they can gift you a Prime membership using one of Amazon’s gift cards.\n\n\nCreate an account\n\n\nOnce you’ve decided which plan you’re going to go with, you’ll need an Amazon account. If you don’t already have one, you’ll need to sign up. Click on Start your free 30-day trial and then Create your Amazon account to set one up with your name, email, and password. We strongly recommend setting up two-factor authentication for your account as well.\n\n\n\nOn the next page, Amazon will verify your account by sending what it calls an OTP (one-time password) to your email. Go to your email, copy the OTP, paste it into the Amazon page, and click Verify.\n\n\n\nYou’ll then be asked to enter your credit or debit card information.\n\n\n\nAnd you’re done!\n\n\nWe should probably mention the obvious: you can sign up for a Prime membership, take advantage of the free 30-day trial, and then cancel it after Black Friday and Cyber Monday have ended. But you can only do that once, so you won’t be able to use that trick next year when Prime Day or Black Friday comes around.\n\nUpdate, October 27th: This article was first published on June 9th, 2021, and has been updated to reflect new information regarding Amazon’s forthcoming Black Friday / Cyber Monday sale.",

Ars does not accept paid editorial content.\nTurbochargers have been injecting more power into engines for over 100 years, but never before have they been so prevalent in our cars. A little boost can add a lot of power and efficiency, too, making a turbocharger a great solution to eke maximum performance out of today’s engines. Usually, though, that comes with the penalty of throttle lag: You put your foot to the floor, and nothing much happens for a beat or two.\nAs we’ve recently seen in our review of the new 911 GTS, Porsche’s engineers have worked some magic to create a turbocharger that provides all the power and fun of forced induction but with none of the throttle response penalty. If adding one high-tech, high-voltage turbocharger is good, surely two would be better, right? Indeed, it is, if you can afford the cost of entry. Meet the 701 hp (523 kW) 2026 911 Turbo S, Porsche’s new most powerful 911 ever.\nTwinning the T-Hybrid\nFor Porsche’s first hybrid 911, the GTS, the company didn’t simply add an electric motor and bigger battery into the mix and call it a day. It also inserted another high-speed motor into the turbocharger, enabling it to spin up to maximum speed in less than a second, nearly eliminating turbo lag.Read full article\nComments",

      "published": "2025-10-27T22:42:33",
      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\tDarren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp, during the Summit on Methane and Other Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases on day three of the COP28 climate conference at Expo City in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Saturday, Dec. 2, 2023. | Photo: Getty Images\t\n\nExxonMobil is suing California over state laws that compel large companies to share a more comprehensive picture of their greenhouse gas emissions, as well as disclose financial risks that climate change might pose to their investors.\n\nThe oil and gas company claims that the two laws in question aim to “embarrass” large corporations the state “believes are uniquely responsible for climate change” in order to push them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. There is overwhelming scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels cause climate change by trapping heat on the planet. \n\nExxonMobil alleges that California is violating the First Amendment by setting specific standards for how certain companies report those emissions and the associated climate risks. Under laws the state passed in 2023, “ExxonMobil will be forced to describe its emissions and climate-related risks in terms the company fundamentally disagrees with,” a complaint filed Friday says. The suit asks a US District Court to stop the laws from being enforced.\n\nIt’s the latest in an ongoing saga over how transparent companies should be about their impact on the climate\n\nIt’s the latest in an ongoing saga over how transparent companies should be about their impact on the climate. California has set higher standards than many companies follow in their sustainability reports. That, plus the state’s enormous economy, has allowed it to raise the bar for corporate climate disclosures even as the federal government moves in the opposite direction. ExxonMobil’s accusations that the state is compelling corporations to adopt its views on climate change also follow a landslide of allegations that ExxonMobil has misled consumers about the impact its products would have on the environment. \n\nOne of the laws ExxonMobil is suing over, SB 253, requires companies doing business in California with more than $1 billion in annual revenue to disclose their emissions according to internationally recognized standards set in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The company already publicly shares data on its greenhouse gas emissions, but says it disagrees with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s methods. The big tussle is over requirements to include emissions from a company’s supply chain, electricity use, and consumer use of its products — considered “indirect” emissions. Those indirect emissions often make up the majority of a company’s carbon footprint, and SB 253 would require full disclosure of them by 2027. \n\nExxonMobil’s suit, however, claims that including indirect emissions leads to double counting. It would mandate that the company claim tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks that burn their fuels, for example, while the owners of those vehicles might also claim those emissions in their reporting.&nbsp;\n\nThe other law in dispute, SB 261, says that companies earning more than $500 million in annual revenue need to disclose financial risks they face from climate change, such as how coastal flooding or more extreme weather might impact their business, by January 2026. The suit calls such disclosures “speculative,” requiring “the company to engage in granular conjecture about unknowable future developments.” \n\nUnder the Biden administration, the SEC proposed similar rules at the federal level, which it ultimately weakened after facing pushback from industry over requirements to disclose indirect emissions. This year, the SEC under the Trump administration announced that it would no longer defend those rules in court.  \n\nSeparately, ExxonMobil is embroiled in another suit California filed against it last year over plastic pollution. That suit claims that the company “deceived Californians for almost half a century by promising that recycling could and would solve the ever-growing plastic waste crisis.” Plastics are made from fossil fuels and are difficult to recycle; less than 10 percent of plastic waste has ever been recycled. ExxonMobil subsequently filed a defamation lawsuit against the California Attorney General in January over the disputed recycling claims.  \n\nCalifornia filed another suit in 2023 against multiple oil and gas companies including Exxon, alleging their “deceptive and tortious conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about these devastating climate change impacts in California,” including more intense heat, droughts, wildfires. Over the past decade a series of investigations into ExxonMobil, as well as peer-reviewed research, have shown how the company’s own scientists accurately predicted climate change while publicly dismissing the issue.\n\nExxonMobil’s latest suit now says the company “understands the very real risks associated with climate change and supports continued efforts to address those risks,” but that California’s laws would force it “to describe its emissions and climate-related risks in terms the company fundamentally disagrees with.”&nbsp;\n\n“These laws are about transparency. ExxonMobil might want to continue keeping the public in the dark, but we’re ready to litigate vigorously in court to ensure the public’s access to these important facts,” Christine Lee, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice, said in an email to The Verge. Officials with the state regulatory agency named as defendants in the suit declined to comment on pending litigation.",

This morning, the DHS posted an image featuring Halo characters, a Warthog vehicle from the games, and the text “DESTROY THE FLOOD” and a link to ICE’s recruitment website. The DHS captioned the post, “finishing this fight.”\n\n\nFinishing this fight. pic.twitter.com/6Ezq9NUqMq&mdash; Homeland Security (@DHSgov) October 27, 2025\n\n\nLike with its Pokémon-themed post, which was captioned, “Gotta Catch ‘Em All,” the DHS’s Halo post implicitly compares immigrants to creatures from video games — this time, the parasitic alien species called the Flood.&nbsp;\n\nThe DHS’s post was the culmination of a social media exchange between the Trump administration and video game retailer GameStop, based on a joke that Trump had overseen the end of the “console wars” thanks to the announcement of the Halo: Combat Evolved remake for PlayStation next year. GameStop, whose CEO and chairman Ryan Cohen has been a vocal supporter of Trump, quoted the joke with a picture of Trump shaking hands with Halo protagonist Master Chief. The White House followed up with an image of Trump in a suit of armor similar to Master Chief’s, and GameStop responded with its own photoshopped Master Chief Trump, adding a meme-ified version of Vice President JD Vance’s head swapped onto what looks to be the feminine anthropomorphic AI Cortana.\n\n\nhttps://t.co/8DRFpgbFv5 pic.twitter.com/wWvOYrwSUR&mdash; GameStop (@gamestop) October 27, 2025\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/jI0ZrstLgz pic.twitter.com/VS32cV0RG7&mdash; GameStop (@gamestop) October 27, 2025\n\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment about the DHS’s post, and didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the White House’s and GameStop’s posts. The Pokémon Company International, in response to Pokémon being associated with Trump’s mass deportation campaign, previously said in a statement to The Daily Beast that “our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.”\n\nCorrection, October 27th: The Pokémon Company International provided the statement to The Daily Beast, not Nintendo, as we originally stated.",

Lux is slated to come online fairly soon in early 2026, with Discovery following in 2029.&nbsp;\n\nBoth build on the work that went into the Frontier supercomputer, which is also housed at ORNL and was the fastest in the world until El Capitan came online last year at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. AMD also helped develop those supercomputers, so this isn’t its first time working with the US government on a project like this.&nbsp;\n\nA press release announcing the partnership describes Lux as an “AI Factory,” stating:\n\n\nLux at ORNL is the nation’s first dedicated AI Factory for science, energy, and national security—purpose-built to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI foundation models that will accelerate discovery and engineering innovation. Lux is designed to accelerate AI-driven science through its advanced architecture, optimized for data-intensive and model-centric workloads.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Discovery is described as having a “Bandwidth Everywhere” design that improves on the performance and energy efficiency the Frontier supercomputer offers, delivering more computing output at a similar cost. That processing power will support scientific research in a variety of areas, as the press release explains:\n\n\nDiscovery will drive breakthroughs in energy, biology, advanced materials, national security, and manufacturing innovation.

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\tYou can now watch your favorite video podcasts on your big screen with Spotify’s new tvOS app update. | Image: Spotify\t\n\nSpotify has announced a redesigned version of its Apple TV app that the company says has been “rebuilt from the ground up for a faster, smarter, more visual experience.” The tvOS version of the Spotify app is also gaining several welcome features from the mobile version, but the biggest updates include the addition of video podcasts and music videos.&nbsp;\n\nSome users have had access to the update for a few days already, but the new version is now available to download for everyone through Apple’s App Store, while devices using automatic updates should get the new experience by mid-November. Users of the old version of Spotify’s tvOS app have previously taken to online forums, including Reddit, to complain about everything from its frustrating navigation to missing features that have long been included in the Google TV version of the app, but it looks like this version is addressing them.&nbsp;\n\nWatching music videos on Spotify isn’t available in the US or Canada yet, but the feature has already expanded to 97 different markets around the world, with a limited catalog for Spotify Premium subscribers. They’re easily accessible using a “switch to video” prompt that appears when a song you’re listening to has an accompanying music video in Spotify’s catalog.\n\nPodcasts offering a video version will work in a similar manner in the new Spotify tvOS app, and will include an option to adjust the playback speed. Earlier this month, the company’s podcast studio announced a partnership with Netflix and The Ringer to bring 16 video podcast series to the video streaming platform in the US starting in 2026, including The Bill Simmons Podcast and shows based on the NFL, NBA, Fantasy Football, and F1.\n\nThe updated Spotify Apple TV app also adds new mobile features like queue management, seamless playback, song lyrics, and access to Spotify DJ, which uses AI to recommend what to listen to next. You’ll also be able to control playback on the Apple TV using your smartphone or tablet and the mobile app through Spotify Connect.",

Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below.\n\nBut even if you’re looking for something a little more extra, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can still find a delightful new device. We finally have a folding phone that offers full water and dust resistance, there are flip phones that offer more than just nostalgia, and you can still buy a phone with no fewer than four cameras on the back. Not bad for a boring season of phone hardware.\n\nA lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — it’s how I bought mine. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming.\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $600. For those recommendations, check out our guide to budget smartphones.\n\nThe best iPhone for most people\nApple iPhone 17\n\nScore: 8ProsConsAlways-on display makes it vastly more usefulHigh refresh rate makes using the phone smootherThe cameras are solidBattery lasts well through the dayThe price isn’t going upNo redesign, but the green is niceZoom capabilities are weak compared to the ProGets hot during heavy gaming sessionsApple Intelligence is still somewhere between useless and MIA\nWhere to Buy: $799 at Apple (256GB) $829.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $999 at Apple (512GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;A19 /&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;Not advertised /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe (Qi2) /&nbsp;Weather-resistance:&nbsp;IP68\n\nThis year’s standard iPhone offers a handful of major upgrades over its predecessor, including a larger 6.3-inch screen with a 120Hz panel and an always-on display. These two features make the everyday experience meaningfully better, but they’re not the only ones: you also get faster performance, better battery life, and twice the amount of base storage at 256GB. It also has the same starting price of $799, which is a shockingly great deal.\n\nOn the camera front, the iPhone 17’s new 48-megapixel ultrawide matches the Pro’s resolution, delivering sharper, more vibrant shots, while the main camera remains reliably good in most conditions. It also features the Pro’s 18-megapixel selfie camera, which lets you take horizontal shots without rotating the device. If you care about zoom or portraits, the iPhone 17’s lack of a telephoto camera is the clearest reason to go Pro. For most people, though, the device’s 2x “optical quality” zoom will be fine for everyday snaps, making it a great upgrade.\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 review.\n\nThe best Android phone for most people\nGoogle Pixel 10\n\nScore: 8ProsConsQi2 wireless charging with magnets is greatAI is actually kind of useful, finallyTelephoto camera is a nice additionMain and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as the ProBattery life is just okay\nWhere to Buy: $799 at Amazon (128GB) $799 at Best Buy (128GB) $799 at Google (128GB)\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 13-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,970mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP68\n\nThe Pixel 10 is an easygoing Android phone that offers some handy upgrades over its predecessor. The addition of Qi2 with built-in magnets is a delight, making it easier than ever to quickly charge up without plugging in. AI features like Magic Cue, which can proactively suggest information based on what you’re doing on your phone, are finally showing promise. And for the first time ever, the base model features a dedicated telephoto lens.\n\nBut, alas, there’s a catch: The Pixel 10 no longer features the same main and ultrawide camera hardware as the Pro. You’re essentially getting the two rear cameras found in the midrange Pixel 9A, plus a telephoto lens. Still, as a whole, the device’s triple camera system produces images that are totally fine. Beyond the cameras, the Pixel 10 features the same Tensor G5 chipset that’s found in the Pro phones — handy for those aforementioned AI features.\n\nOverall, the Pixel 10 mostly improves upon what made last year’s Pixel 9 such a solid release. We’re not thrilled with the downgraded camera, but the addition of Qi2 and a telephoto lens helps to soften the blow. If you can live with the camera tradeoffs, the Pixel 10 is still a smart pick for anyone who wants a flagship experience at a more approachable price.\n\nRead our full Pixel 10 review.\n\nThe best high-end Android phone\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n\nScore: 8ProsConsExcellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfierExpensiveBulkyAI is (still) hit or miss\nWhere to Buy: $1299.99 $949.99 at Amazon (256GB) $1299.99 $949.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $1419.99 $1141.08 at Amazon (512GB)\nScreen: 6.9-inch, 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS; 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless, Qi2 ready / Weather resistance: IP68\n\nSamsung’s “Ultra” S-series phone is still your best bet for a maximalist Android phone, even if ultra doesn’t quite mean what it once did. You still get four rear cameras — including a 3x and 5x telephoto — a massive screen, and a built-in S Pen stylus. The battery goes all day, the processor is top-notch, and there are AI features aplenty if you’re into that sort of thing. There’s just no other phone quite like it. \n\nThis year, Samsung removed the Bluetooth features from the stylus. That stings a little, especially considering that the company swapped a 10x zoom for the shorter 5x camera the year before. It still amounts to a great phone, but it’s one of the priciest slab-style phones you can buy, and Samsung seems to be cutting features without adding back any extra value. It’s still “ultra” alright, but it doesn’t feel quite as special as it used to.\n\nRead my full Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\n\nThe best phone for around $500\nGoogle Pixel 9A\n\nScore: 8ProsConsRobust IP68 ratingSeven years of software updatesBrighter, bigger screenMissing a couple of AI featuresAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\nWhere to Buy: $499 $484.49 at Amazon (128GB) $499 at Best Buy (128GB) $499 at Google (128GB)\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance: IP68\n\nEvery year, we’re pleasantly surprised by how much Google packs into its midrange Pixel A-series devices. Last year, it was the Pixel 8A, and this year, it’s the even better Pixel 9A. For $500, the 9A offers Google’s fourth-gen custom Tensor G4 chipset (the very same chip that’s in the pricier Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro), a brighter and larger 6.3-inch OLED display, and an IP68 rating for improved durability. Plus, you get the benefit of seven years of software updates and security support. What you end up with is a device that delivers fantastic value, especially compared to other inexpensive devices.\n\nThe Pixel 9A offers a handful of other features that put it above the pack, like a 120Hz refresh rate, wireless charging, and the largest battery across the Pixel line. It does fall short in a few areas, though — the camera’s low light performance and Portrait mode could be better. That said, the 9A’s camera is still great for everyday snaps, and for the price, the device is an easy recommendation as the best in this category.\n\nRead my full Pixel 9A review.\n\nThe best high-end iPhone\niPhone 17 Pro\n\nScore: 8ProsConsSolid battery lifeBrighter screen outdoorsCenter Stage cameraFaster chargingDoesn’t get blazing hotOrangeWhat’s up with Siri?Heavier than last year\nWhere to Buy: $1099 at Apple (256GB) $1099.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $1299 at Apple (512GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;A19 Pro /&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;Not advertised /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;40W wired, 25W MagSafe (Qi2) /&nbsp;Weather-resistance:&nbsp;IP68\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro is the model to get if you want Apple’s most capable camera system and the longest battery life you can get in an iPhone. All three rear sensors use 48-megapixel lenses — including the telephoto with 4x zoom — and support creator-focused tools like ProRes RAW. Apple’s switch to an aluminum body with a vapor chamber also helps keep temperatures low during intensive tasks, including high-res video recording, while the Ceramic Shield 2 front improves durability. And it’s all wrapped in a fresh, rounded design.\n\nAs part of that redesign, Apple carved out the frame to fit a larger battery, which lasts through a typical day of mixed use while browsing social media, gaming, etc. The 17 Pro supports 40W wired charging and slightly faster MagSafe charging, allowing you to take it from zero to 50 percent in as little as 20 minutes. It also supports USB 3 for lightning-fast transfer speeds, so you can quickly copy over all your vacation photos and videos to your laptop.\n\nSince the standard iPhone 17 has the same 120Hz refresh rate and an always‑on display, it’s easier to skip the Pro this year. That being said, if you want longer battery life and the most flexible camera system in the lineup, the 17 Pro is the way to go. Plus, it comes in a bold orange shade that’s unlike anything else in Apple’s lineup.\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 Pro review.\n\nThe best flip phone\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\n\nScore: 8ProsConsSamsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable cameraMore susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen\nWhere to Buy: $1099.99 $849.99 at Amazon (256GB) $1099.99 at Best Buy (256GB) $1219.99 $1149 at Amazon (512GB)\nScreen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather resistance: IP48\n\nSamsung finally got the memo with the Galaxy Z Flip 7’s cover screen. The company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look of its predecessor for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. With more outer screen real estate, it’s easier to respond to texts and punch in a coffee order without flipping open the phone and getting sucked into a digital rabbit hole.\n\nThe Flip 7 still makes you jump through a few hoops if you want to run full apps on the cover screen, but once you’ve wrangled the settings, it unlocks a lot of convenience for everyday tasks. That said, the cover screen isn’t perfect for every app. Sometimes a button hides behind the camera cutout, forcing you to change the app’s window size. But most tasks are a breeze, and opening the phone is always an option.\n\nUnder the hood, Samsung swapped out Qualcomm’s processor for an in-house Exynos chip, though we didn’t notice any hits to performance. The new 4,300mAh battery will last you all day with moderate use, but heavy gaming and hotspot use will significantly impact battery life. The camera system, meanwhile, remains unchanged from the Z Flip 6, which isn’t a bad thing. You still get a 50-megapixel main shooter and all the fun flex mode tricks, which are great for capturing candids.\n\nUnfortunately, the Flip 7 still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, which might work their way into the hinge and cause damage. This raises concerns about how the device might hold up over time. But Samsung’s beefed-up warranty and repair program can provide extra peace of mind. Plus, with seven years of OS and security updates, the Flip 7 should prove reliable until you decide to upgrade.\n\nRead our full Galaxy Z Flip 7 review.\n\nThe best folding phone\nGoogle Pixel Pro 10 Fold\n\nScore: 8ProsConsFull dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnetsHeavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone\nWhere to Buy: $1799 at Amazon (256GB) $1799 at Best Buy (256GB) $1799 at Google (256GB)\nScreen:&nbsp;8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen /&nbsp;Processor:&nbsp;Google Tensor G5 /&nbsp;Cameras:&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera /&nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;5,015mAh /&nbsp;Charging:&nbsp;30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) /&nbsp;Weather resistance:&nbsp;IP68\n\nConcerns over long-term durability have kept us from recommending foldables to anyone but the most diehard gadget nerd. Then Google said “hold my USB-C cable” and bestowed an IP68 rating on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, making it the first foldable to provide full water and dust resistance. That means the device can survive a tumble on the beach without the hinge and inner screen failing. What’s more, the device features Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging. And with a new Tensor G5 chip, it offers smooth performance, whether you’re playing intensive games like Diablo Immortal or multitasking on the larger inner display.\n\nAs much as we love the 10 Pro Fold’s improved durability, its cameras can’t quite keep up with those of other 10 Pro models. The device is also heavy and rather chunky; it’s over 40 grams heavier than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 and nearly 2 millimeters thicker when folded shut. There’s a plus side to the thicker frame, though: it leaves more room for the phone’s larger battery, which can last a full day with minimal use of the inner display. If you find yourself spending most of your time using the larger display, you may need to find the nearest outlet by the end of the day.\n\nRead our full Pixel 10 Pro Fold review.\n\n\n\nOther phones we tested\n\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 is a very good device, and it’s basically the last small-ish Android phone you can buy in the US. I find the software to be fussier and more cluttered than the Pixel 9’s, so it’s not my overall pick, but it’s a reliable device — and your best bet for a phone that isn’t gigantic. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe iPhone 16E is a great phone that makes a lot of interesting trade-offs. Apple’s latest entry-level phone starts at $599 and comes with the company’s latest A18 processor, USB-C and wireless charging, a 60Hz OLED display, and the customizable Action Button found on Apple’s more premium handsets. The 6.1-inch phone doesn’t have MagSafe support or a Camera Control button, though, and it’s limited to a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera (sorry, ultrawide stans). That makes it hard for us to recommend over the standard iPhone 16, even if it does start at $200 less. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is an excellent foldable that exemplifies what makes the brand’s phones so unique. It’s one of the best-looking phones you can buy, thanks to its gold-bronze chassis and wooden back. Plus, it features a spacious cover screen that’s handy for quickly performing tasks without opening the device. However, as much as we enjoy the Razr Ultra, Motorola’s promise of three OS upgrades and four years of security updates is on the shorter side. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is an ultra-thin alternative to the big, chunky flagships we’ve seen over the past year. At just 5.8mm thick, it packs a 6.7-inch 1440p OLED display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, a 3,900mAh battery, and a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. Despite its thinner frame, battery life is surprisingly acceptable, though it won’t last as long as other flagship devices. The S25 Edge also lacks a telephoto camera, so it’s not the best phone for portrait photos. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe OnePlus 13R stands out in two key ways: battery life and screen. The 6.78-inch OLED display has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a resolution of 1264 x 2780, both of which are great specs for a midrange phone. Meanwhile, its 6,000mAh battery can last for a long time — most people are likely to squeeze out two days before the device needs to be recharged. That said, the 13R lacks features like wireless charging and more robust water resistance, and OnePlus is only promising four major OS upgrades and six years of security updates, which is fewer than the seven years of OS upgrades on the Google Pixel 9A. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;Nothing Phone 3 is the brand’s “first true flagship phone,” with a 6.67-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chip, and a 5,150mAh battery. It also features four cameras — three on the back and one on the front — all of which are 50 megapixels. Additionally, the Phone 3 ditches Nothing’s&nbsp;signature light strips&nbsp;for a small dot-matrix LED display on the back, which can display images or emoji tied to specific apps and contacts. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;Pixel 9 Pro Fold&nbsp;is an impressive sophomore effort from Google. Like the Z Fold 7, the outer screen matches the dimensions of a regular slab-style phone, while the inner screen is great for multitasking. The whole package is also light enough that it sometimes doesn’t feel like you’re holding a foldable, though it does suffer from a slightly downgraded camera system compared to other Pixel 9 devices. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so long-term durability remains a concern.&nbsp;Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s most refined flagship yet, blending a premium design with meaningful hardware upgrades like the Tensor G5 chip and Pixelsnap wireless charging. Magic Cue delivers genuinely useful on-device AI that can surface helpful info in real-time, while the camera’s portrait mode is much improved over its predecessor. Battery life is just average, though, and some AI features still feel like they’re being shoved into corners of the device where it doesn’t really need to be. Most readers will be better served by the cheaper Pixel 10. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is another thin book-style foldable that feels like a regular phone when folded shut, though its IP48 rating means it isn’t fully dust resistant. The spacious inner display is great for multitasking and gaming, and its battery can last all day with moderate use. However, with a starting price of $2,000 — $200 more than the 10 Pro Fold — it’s the most expensive device on this list, even if we have seen it occasionally drop to $1,599.&nbsp;Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe iPhone Air is Apple’s biggest redesign in years, one that measures 5.6mm thick and weighs a mere 165 grams. It’s&nbsp;more durable&nbsp;than you might expect, too, thanks to its titanium frame and Ceramic Shield 2, and it feels deceptively small despite having a 6.5-inch display. However, there are a few downsides to the thinner frame, including shorter battery life and the lack of an ultrawide camera. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nWe’re in a relatively quiet period now that Google and Apple have released their latest handsets. There might be a few more surprises in store for the remainder of 2025 — Samsung has yet to release its heavily rumored trifold — but we haven’t heard much since the summer. Regardless, now is a great time to start taking stock of any deals you see, especially with Black Friday and Cyber Monday around the corner.\n\nUpdate, October 27th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold as new picks.

The researchers also looked at GPT-4o’s web search mode and the separate “GPT-4o with Search Tool,” which resorts to searching the web only when the LLM decides it needs information found outside its own pre-trained data.\nThe researchers drew test queries from a number of sources, including specific questions submitted to ChatGPT in the WildChat dataset, general political topics listed on AllSides, and products included in the 100 most-searched Amazon products list.Read full article\nComments",

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\nLast week, General Motors CEO Mary Barra caused a stir when she said that the company would eventually kill Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in all of its gas cars. The company had already successfully removed phone mirroring capabilities from most of its electric vehicles, and now it was plotting how to drop support from its internal combustion engine vehicles too. \n\nBut today, the company is clarifying that this won’t happen overnight. \n\n“We are not making any changes to existing vehicles,” Malorie Lucich, a spokesperson for GM, said in a statement. “If your car supports Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, that will continue. Both will remain available in all GM gas-powered vehicles for the foreseeable future. As we advance toward our centralized computing platform, we’ll gradually move to a better, more deeply integrated experience — a direction the broader industry is taking as vehicles become more software-defined. This will happen over time, not overnight. We value our collaboration with Apple and Google and remain focused on delivering experiences customers love.”\n\n(The statement was originally provided to MacRumors.)\n\nOn the Decoder podcast, Barra seemed to suggest that the removal would happen as new models were refreshed. “As we move forward with each new vehicle and major new vehicle launch, I think you’re going to see us consistent on that,” she said. \n\nNow it seems like it won’t happen until GM is ready to roll out the new centralized vehicle computing platform it announced last week. That system, which reduces the number of control modules and improves the ability for over-the-air software updates, is set to make its debut on the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028, before moving on to the automaker’s gas lineup.

Credit: Siamak Mirfendereski and Ankur Gupta/CU Boulder\n\n          \n  \n  \n\n\nA zebra’s distinctive black-and-white stripes, or a leopard’s spots, are both examples of “Turing patterns,” after mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, who proposed an intriguing hypothetical mechanism for how such complex, irregular patterns might emerge in nature. But Turing’s original proposal proved too simplified to fully re-create those natural patterns. Scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) have devised a new modeling approach that achieves much more accurate final patterns by introducing deliberate imperfections, according to a new paper published in the journal Matter.\nTuring focused on chemicals known as morphogens in his seminal 1952 paper. He devised a mechanism involving the interaction between an activator chemical that expresses a unique characteristic (like a tiger’s stripe) and an inhibitor chemical that periodically kicks in to shut down the activator’s expression. Both activator and inhibitor diffuse throughout a system, much like gas atoms will do in an enclosed box. It’s a bit like injecting a drop of black ink into a beaker of water. Normally, this would stabilize a system, and the water would gradually turn a uniform gray. But if the inhibitor diffuses at a faster rate than the activator, the process is destabilized. That mechanism will produce spots or stripes.\nScientists have tried to apply this basic concept to many different kinds of systems. For instance, neurons in the brain could serve as activators and inhibitors, depending on whether they amplify or dampen the firing of other nearby neurons—possibly the reason why we see certain patterns when we hallucinate. There is evidence for Turing mechanisms at work in zebra-fish stripes, the spacing between hair follicles in mice, feather buds on a bird’s skin, the ridges on a mouse’s palate, and the digits on a mouse’s paw.Read full article\nComments",
