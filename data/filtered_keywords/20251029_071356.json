      "content": "In today’s newsletter: Meteorologists have called it ‘a dire situation unfolding in slow motion’ – what will it leave behind?Good morning. Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to hit Jamaica since records began in 1851, made landfall at about midday local time on Tuesday. With winds reaching 185mph and torrential rains, it knocked out power lines, cut off the internet, and demolished buildings; the death toll and extent of the damage are still unknown.The storm has already hit Haiti and the Dominican Republic; though it was at one stage downgraded to a tropical storm, now it has strengthened again and is expected to arrive imminently in Cuba, where more than 700,000 people have been evacuated. “The reports that are coming in are catastrophic,” Jamaican energy and transport minister Daryl Vaz told Sky News. “Not very much survives a Category 5 hurricane, in terms of infrastructure.”Economy | Rachel Reeves has said Britain can defy gloomy economic forecasts after the fiscal watchdog infuriated ministers by predicting a productivity downgrade would leave her with a £20bn gap to fill in her forthcoming budget.Sudan | Ethnically motivated mass killings and other atrocities are being reported from El Fasher after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces took control of the city in Sudan’s western Darfur region over the weekend.UK news | Downing Street has defended the prospect of paying more to house asylum seekers in disused barracks instead of hotels, arguing that quelling public disquiet was worth the extra cost. No 10 said that “communities don’t want asylum seekers housed in hotels, and neither does the government”.Middle East | Israeli warplanes struck Gaza on Tuesday night, shortly after Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, ordered the military to carry out “powerful strikes” in Gaza, in the most serious test of the increasingly shaky US-brokered ceasefire.Television | Prunella Scales, the actor best known for playing Sybil Fawlty in the classic comedy series Fawlty Towers, has died aged 93. Scales, who was married to fellow actor Timothy West, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2013. Continue reading...",

I know there’s a lot of interest in it. I think ultimately there’s an ability there for the Coalition to do this much better than Labor. Labor’s net zero [policy] has been a disaster …I think we could do net zero better than Labor in terms of emissions and cost and environmental protection, but you’ve got to keep net zero.I know that you probably find it all very interesting to talk about, but we do have a culture of openness in the Liberal party and the National party, and we seem to talk about a lot of things. I mean, frankly, I wonder what the nation will talk about if the Liberal party died, because I think we’d sort of run out of things to discuss.Communities around the country are trying to focus and talk about the issues that matter to them, not try to make some fake news thing out of a T-shirt the prime minister gets wearing off a plane. It’s ridiculous.Look, there’s a lot to legitimately criticise the prime minister about trillion dollar debt, skyrocketing house prices and job losses in our heavy industrial sector wearing a T-shirt is not one of them … So yeah, get on with acting on antisemitism.

Unlike Kohler’s Dekoda, which uses a camera to analyze your poop, the U-Scan detects and samples your urine, tests it using replaceable cartridges, and sends the results to the Withings app, where you’ll get tips on how to improve your health if needed.\n\nThe device is finally launching in the US and Europe today with two different cartridges. The U-Scan Nutrio monitors nutrition by measuring four urinary biomarkers — including hydration, ketones, and vitamin C — while the U-Scan Calci tracks parameters such as calcium levels to monitor kidney health and the potential for developing kidney stones. The cartridge for tracking reproductive health that was announced alongside the U-Scan at CES 2023 won’t be available at launch, and while the device was originally waiting for FDA clearance, Withings now classifies it as a “wellness product,” so clearance isn’t necessary.\n\nPricing starts at $349.95 for the Proactive option, which includes the U-Scan itself, a charging and cleaning station, access to the Withings Plus service, and a single Nutrio or Calci cartridge with 22 tests that will last up to three months with just two weekly measurements. The $429.95 Intensive option instead includes two cartridges and 44 tests, facilitating more tests per week. Replacement cartridges, which can be shipped regularly as part of a subscription plan, are $99.95 each or $179.95 a pair.",

Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced the GUARD Act on Tuesday, which would also ban everyone under 18 from accessing AI chatbots, as reported earlier by NBC News. \n\nThe bill comes just weeks after safety advocates and parents attended a Senate hearing to call attention to the impact of AI chatbots on kids. Under the legislation, AI companies would have to verify ages by requiring users to upload their government ID or provide validation through another “reasonable” method, which might include something like face scans.\n\nAI chatbots would be required to disclose that they aren’t human at 30-minute intervals under the bill. They would also have to include safeguards that prevent them from claiming that they are a human, similar to an AI safety bill recently passed in California. The bill would make it illegal to operate a chatbot that produces sexual content for minors or promotes suicide, too.\n\n“Our legislation imposes strict safeguards against exploitative or manipulative AI, backed by tough enforcement with criminal and civil penalties,” Blumenthal says in a statement provided to The Verge. “Big Tech has betrayed any claim that we should trust companies to do the right thing on their own when they consistently put profit first ahead of child safety.”",

      "content": "On Tuesday, Westinghouse announced that it had reached an agreement with the Trump administration that would purportedly see $80 billion of new nuclear reactors built in the US. And the government indicated that it had finalized plans for a collaboration of GE Vernova and Hitachi to build additional reactors. Unfortunately, there are roughly zero details about the deal at the moment.\nThe agreements were apparently negotiated during President Trump’s trip to Japan. An announcement of those agreements indicates that “Japan and various Japanese companies” would invest “up to” $332 billion for energy infrastructure. This specifically mentioned Westinghouse, GE Vernova, and Hitachi. This promises the construction of both large AP1000 reactors and small modular nuclear reactors. The announcement then goes on to indicate that many other companies would also get a slice of that “up to $332 billion,” many for basic grid infrastructure.\nSo the total amount devoted to nuclear reactors is not specified in the announcement or anywhere else. As of the publication time, the Department of Energy has no information on the deal; Hitachi, GE Vernova, and the Hitachi/GE Vernova collaboration websites are also silent on it.Read full article\nComments",

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\nYouTube is updating its policy to age-restrict more content containing video game scenes with “graphic violence,” the company announced on Tuesday. The update will go into effect on November 17th and will prevent accounts under 18 and signed-out users from watching videos with games focused on showing “realistic human characters” involved in scenes of “mass violence against non-combatants” or torture.\n\nWhen choosing whether to restrict a video, YouTube says it will take the length of the graphic scene into account, as well as whether it’s zoomed in or the main focus of a scene. It will also evaluate whether the video shows violence targeted at a character “that looks like a real human.” YouTube’s post doesn’t clarify if this applies to the violence seen in games like Grand Theft Auto, a Call of Duty sequence like the infamous “No Russian” mission, or other kinds of realistically rendered scenes.\n\nHowever, YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle said in a statement to The Verge that “certain content may be age-restricted if it&#8217;s non-fleeting or zoomed in,” adding that “there may be ways the creator can choose to play the mission to avoid content that would lead to an age restriction.” Creators can also choose to blur or obscure the violence, according to Bullwinkle.\n\nThe update builds upon YouTube’s existing policies, which state that the platform may restrict videos featuring “dramatized violence” focused on torture, severe injuries, or violent deaths with blood, with an exception for games. The current policy says, “Generally, we do not remove dramatized violence when the content or metadata lets us know that the content is fictional, or when it’s apparent from the content itself, such as with animated content or video games.”\n\n“YouTube’s policies are designed to adapt to the evolving digital world, and these updates reflect our ongoing commitment to protect younger users and foster a responsible platform,” Bullwinkle said.\n\nIn addition to stricter policies surrounding video games, the update will also prevent creators from directing users to online gambling content involving digital goods, like video game skins, cosmetics, or NFTs. YouTube stopped allowing creators to verbally mention or display online gambling services not approved by Google in March. The platform started blocking approved online gambling content for users under 18 at this time, and now it’s planning to age-restrict social casino content as well.\n\nUpdate, October 28th: Added clarification from YouTube.",

      "content": "\n\n\n\t\n\tNew World: Aeternum.\t\n\nAs part of Amazon’s mass layoffs announced today, the company is making “significant” changes to its gaming division, including halting much of its work on first-party AAA MMOs, according to a memo from Steve Boom, VP of audio, Twitch, and games.&nbsp;\n\n“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Boom said in the memo, which Amazon shared with The Verge.\n\nThe developers of New World: Aeternum, one of Amazon’s MMOs, have already announced plans to stop providing new content updates. The team said it&#8217;s not sunsetting the game “at this time” and that “servers will be live through 2026.” The developers will provide “a minimum of six months’ notice before making any changes that impact your ability” to play the game.\n\nAmazon also publishes the MMOs Throne and Liberty, which is developed by NCSoft and FirstSpark Games, and Lost Ark, developed by Smilegate RPG. “We will continue supporting Throne and Liberty and Lost Ark with regular updates and community engagement,” Amazon spokesperson Brittney Hefner told The Verge. They’ll get new content updates for the foreseeable future, Hefner confirmed.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon announced that it would be developing a Lord of the Rings MMO in partnership with Embracer Group. Amazon and Embracer didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about that game.\n\nLast year, Amazon canceled a planned Western release of the Bandai Namco-developed MMO Blue Protocol, which was shuttered in Japan in January.\n\nAmazon isn’t fully pulling back on its work in games. Boom pointed to the launch of the revamped Luna and said that its Studio 5 team, which developed a courtroom game with an AI Snoop Dogg for the cloud gaming service, will “continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna.” He also said Luna is a “great example” of “how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon” because it “leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members.”\n\nIn addition, Boom highlighted a “successful closed alpha” for the MOBA March of Giants and noted that Amazon is still working with Crystal Dynamics on a new Tomb Raider game (Amazon is also making a Tomb Raider series) and with Maverick Games on a new open-world driving game.\n\nYou can read Boom’s full memo below.&nbsp;\n\n\nDear Games Team,\n\n\n\nThis morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.\n\n\n\nWhile these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming Tomb Raider title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams. Most countries with impacted employees have been notified. Our other global hubs will follow local processes and be notified at a later date.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is no getting around the fact that days like this are hard, and we will be losing team members whose work and dedication have had an incredible impact on our customers over the years. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and yet they are necessary for us to continue to drive our business forward.\n\n\n\nPlease reach out directly to your manager or to your HRBP with any specific questions.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\nSteve\n\n\nUpdates, October 28th: Added details from the New World: Aeternum team and from Amazon about two of its other MMOs.",

These open-ear-style earbuds rest securely in your outer ear rather than inside of your ear canals, allowing you to more easily hear what’s going on around you at all times. Right now, they’re matching their all-time low of $99 ($50 off) at Amazon with a Prime membership and Nothing’s online storefront.\nNothing Ear Open\n\nWhere to Buy: $149 $99 at Amazon (with Prime) $149 $99 at Nothing\nThe Nothing Ear Open join the growing market of open-ear options, which also includes the pricier Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 and Bose Ultra Open. These models all feature designs that prioritize safety over sound quality. Rather than forming a seal in your ear for passive sound isolation, Nothing’s wireless earbuds always let ambient noise in. For runners and cyclists, that means being able to hear vehicles, pedestrians, and other potential hazards. That being said, if you wear glasses like I do, the over-the-ear style can sometimes be difficult to wear with thicker frames, so that’s something to keep in mind.\n\nAlthough Nothing’s earbuds can’t match the audio quality of modern in-ear models, the design of each speaker module helps minimize sound leakage. Meanwhile, each earbud includes a pair of microphones and Nothing’s latest noise-canceling technology, so your voice should sound crystal clear during phone calls. The earbuds also support multipoint Bluetooth and a “Low Lag Mode” for gaming, which can automatically activate if you own a Nothing Phone. Otherwise, you can activate the mode through Nothing’s mobile app.\n\nWhen it comes to battery life, Nothing says the earbuds get up to eight hours on a full charge, with a total of 30 hours with the charging case. Unfortunately, the case doesn’t support wireless charging, though a quick 10-minute charge over USB-C should provide two hours of listening time.",

Today, it announced a new collaboration with Nvidia to use the latter’s hardware and software, with the aim of creating an autonomous vehicle for consumers. Oh, and the AI will apparently design Lucid’s production lines.\nFormed by refugees from Tesla who saw a chance to improve on their past work, Lucid has already built the most efficient EV on sale in North America. But until recently, it also just had variants of the same Air sedan to offer consumers, before the Gravity SUV joined the range this year.\nThe company will need to start selling tens of thousands of EVs a year before too long, especially if it’s ever to become profitable. And that will involve some smaller, cheaper models, starting with a midsize crossover sometime in 2027. A major goal for the first of those EVs is a starting price of less than $50,000, so I hope they’re getting a good deal on the Nvidia GPUs that Lucid now says will enable a “true eyes-off, hands-off, and mind-off” autonomous driving system for consumer-owned vehicles.Read full article\nComments",

It’s a tiny fraction of the overall user base, but with more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to over a million people each week, reports TechCrunch.\nOpenAI also estimates that a similar percentage of users show heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT, and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the chatbot.Read full article\nComments",

For example, the truck will be made from just 600 parts, with no paint or even an infotainment system, to keep costs down.\nAn unanswered question until now has been “where do I take it to be fixed if it breaks?” Today, we have an answer. Slate is partnering with RepairPal to use the latter’s network of more than 4,000 locations across the US.\n“Slate’s OEM partnership with RepairPal’s nationwide network of service centers will give Slate customers peace of mind while empowering independent service shops to provide accessorization and service,” said Slate chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder.Read full article\nComments",

      "published": "2025-10-28T15:17:13",
      "content": "As newer, more efficient silicon manufacturing processes have gotten more expensive and difficult to develop, chipmakers like Intel and AMD have repeatedly rebranded some of their older processors with new model numbers. This has allowed both companies to release “new” products that aren’t actually new at all, muddying the waters for people trying to buy lower-end and midrange laptops.\nAs spotted by Tom’s Hardware, AMD has quietly rebranded a swath of its Ryzen laptop chips with new model numbers without changing the silicon. The rebranded processors use either Rembrandt-R silicon with Zen 3+ CPU cores and RDNA 2 graphics cores or Mendocino silicon with Zen 2 CPU cores and RDNA 2 graphics cores. Both of these architectures first launched in 2022, but Mendocino’s Zen 2 CPU architecture dates all the way back to 2019. During the company’s model number decoder ring era, these designs had been sold as Ryzen 7035- and Ryzen 7020-series chips, respectively.\nThis is actually AMD’s second rebranding for the Rembrandt-R silicon, which was launched as the Ryzen 6000 series in 2022. These chips will compete most directly with Intel’s non-Ultra Core 100 series processors, most of which use 2022-vintage Raptor Lake silicon.Read full article\nComments",

      "published": "2025-10-28T15:02:30",
      "content": "On Monday, Microsoft and OpenAI announced a revised partnership agreement that introduces an independent expert panel to verify when OpenAI achieves so-called artificial general intelligence (AGI), a determination that will trigger major shifts in how the companies share technology and revenue. The deal values Microsoft’s stake in OpenAI at approximately $135 billion and extends the exclusive partnership through 2032 while giving both companies more freedom to pursue AGI independently.\nThe partnership began in 2019 when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI. Since then, Microsoft has provided billions in cloud computing resources through Azure and used OpenAI’s models as the basis of products like Copilot. The new agreement maintains Microsoft as OpenAI’s frontier model partner and preserves Microsoft’s exclusive rights to OpenAI’s IP and Azure API exclusivity until the threshold of AGI is reached.\nUnder a previous arrangement, OpenAI alone would determine when it achieved AGI, which is a nebulous concept that is difficult to define. The revised deal requires an independent expert panel to verify that claim, a change that adds oversight to a determination with billions of dollars at stake. When the panel confirms that AGI has been reached, Microsoft’s intellectual property rights to OpenAI’s research methods will expire, and the revenue-sharing arrangement between the companies will end, though payments will continue over a longer period.Read full article\nComments",

      "content": "On Friday, the California Supreme Court ordered the University of California system to release the details of a proposed deal from the federal government that would restore research grants that were suspended by the Trump administration. The proposed deal, first issued in August, had remained confidential as a suit filed by faculty at UCLA made its way through appeals. With California’s top court now weighing in, the university administrators have released the document, still marked “draft” and “confidential attorney work product.”\nMost of the demands will seem unsurprising to those familiar with the Trump administration’s interest: an end to all diversity programs and those supporting transgender individuals, plus a sharp crackdown on campus protests. The eye-opening portion comes at the price tag of nearly $1.2 billion paid out, with UCLA covering all the costs of compliance. And, as written, the deal wouldn’t stop the Trump administration from cutting the grants for other reasons or imposing more intrusive regulations, such as those mentioned in its university compact.\nFamiliar concerns\nIn many ways, the proposed deal is much more focused than the odd list of demands the administration sent Harvard University earlier this year, in that it targets issues that the administration has focused on repeatedly. These include an end to all diversity programs at both the faculty and student levels. It demands that UCLA agree to “remove explicit or implicit goals for compositional diversity based on race, sex, or ethnicity, including eliminating any secretive or proxy-based ‘diversity’ hiring processes.”Read full article\nComments",
