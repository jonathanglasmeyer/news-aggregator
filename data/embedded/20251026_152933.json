For the last month or so, the app simply didn’t support Apple’s latest phones at all. Adobe was working behind the scenes to get things up and running, and posting occasional updates to the Adobe Community forums. But the company has decided to simply turn off access to the front-facing camera entirely, in order to get some version of Project Indigo out the door with iPhone 17 support.\n\nThe app debuted back in June and immediately started garnering fans who preferred the softer touch it took to processing images, compared to the standard iPhone camera app. But the new sensors in the iPhone 17 series apparently threw Project Indigo for a loop. A fix in iOS 26.1 will allow Adobe to enable selfie camera support as well, but for now, iPhone 17 owners will have to make do with rear-camera support only. \n\n",
